Control is a game mode in overwatch. Playstation players will only be able to play ranked matches against other playstation players while this is pending. I vastly prefer kbm but can play well enough on an xbone controller to keep up. Heroes in overwatch are designed with specific playstyles in mind, and their movesets and abilities vary greatly from character to character.

<p>Please, for the love of everything good in this world, stop allowing players on console to use a mouse and keyboard. Despite the fact that it supports keyboard and mouse inputs, this configuration is not compatible with the playstation 4 or xbox one. These devices are considered as a legitimate xbox one controller, but not for all games. Otherwise i see a few phara’s and lucio’s that are in masters with a controller.</p>
