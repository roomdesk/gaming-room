PS5 Backwards Compatibility Confirmed? SONY REVEAL PS5 From youtube.com
It is now rumored the playstation 5 could have backwards compatibility and will allow players to run ps1, ps2, ps3, and ps4 games. Yet, it is not a pity for few gamers play those incompatible games. Both the ps2 and ps3 are capable of running ps1 games, but other than that gamers have not been able to play ps2 or ps3 games on the most recent playstation console. While microsoft gives players a strong advantage in terms of backward compatibility (with the xbox series x — which plays many xbox 360 and original xbox games), you cannot play any original ps games on the ps5.
