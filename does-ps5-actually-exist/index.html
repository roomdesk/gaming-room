<p>So it isn’t any sort of slouch. That�s right, for the first time in over seven months, we�ve actually been waiting on sony�s reveal. The system is really popular. Does Naughty Dog�s fantasy game for PS5 really exist? New.</p>

The ps5 does not exist. That�s right, for the first time in over seven months, we�ve actually been waiting on sony�s reveal. :p my local walmart regularly has ps5 in stock but only the physical/disk.</p>

It�s the most powerful playstation ever made. So what i can 100% guarantee you beyond all doubt, is that the ps5 does not include an hdmi 2.1 ultra high speed certified category 3.
