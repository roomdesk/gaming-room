Is PlayStation 3 Compatible With PS2? From lifewire.com
The original 60gb and 20gb launch models are backward compatible with ps2 games because they have ps2 chips in them. Initial playstation 3 models released in north america, japan, and asia contained both the playstation 2�s cpu and gpu, while subsequent models contained only the gpu, and the playstation 2 backwards compatibility with physical discs was removed entirely in later models. If in doubt, buy one of the ones that looks super old and you should be fine! A new playstation patent suggests the ps5, and possibly the ps4, are finally getting ps3, ps2, and ps1 backward compatibility.
