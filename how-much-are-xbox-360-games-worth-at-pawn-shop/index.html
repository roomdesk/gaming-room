Gaming specials this weekend From mygaming.co.za
Nowadays, i doubt you can get anything for a broken 360 from anyone. This would depend on the specific model and what else you have with it (controllers / games). Generally speaking, used xbox 360s tend to sell for between $20 and $120. On the flip side, if you sell an xbox 360 without cables or anything else, it might be worth as little as $15.
