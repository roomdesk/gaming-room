M131 ZJFKSDYX C91 Pro Gaming Keyboard and Mouse with Video From carousell.sg
Connect your xbox one controller to the apex hub with a micro usb cable. This entirely wired option is also easy to set up. I dont really keep up with news on the game but i know the game was allowing me to play with my mk on xbox apex back then. I bought a keyboard and mouse today at walmart and it registered on the xbox to where i could use it but i went onto apex legends to use it and it doesn�t support it.
