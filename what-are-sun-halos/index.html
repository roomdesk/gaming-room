Sometimes sun dogs can have a flaring white tail leading away from the sun. The phenomenon happens when light refracts through the ice crystals high up in the atmosphere. Sundogs, light pillars, and other kinds of halos seen in the sky are atmospheric phenomena that occur when light is reflected or refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. They also cause a ring of light to appear around the sun.
