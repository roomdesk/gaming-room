<p>Does a pretty good job of introducing new stuff (escharum and endless are at the absolute top of the list for all of halo) while plucking at various installments for others (lots of hce and h2 inspiration on stuff like through the trees, h4 vibes from adjutant resolution). 343 showed the arbiter in the halo 2 anniversary halo 5 teaser as his classic design with gold armor, but then in halo 5, he was the halo 5 design somehow, which kind of breaks canon. The arbiter didn’t have to be at the forefront like the halo 3 days but at least a dialogue line would have been nice to hear what was going on with them.
