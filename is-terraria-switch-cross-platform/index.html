<p>So, players using nintendo switch to play terraria cannot match with the players using pc. Each platform uses it�s own network to communicate and doesn�t allow other platforms to use theirs. Currently, there is no other platform that offers this feature. To connect to one another, all mobile devices must be on the same network and multiplayer version.</p>
