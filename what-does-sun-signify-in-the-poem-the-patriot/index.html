The Patriot Poem by Robert Browning Poem Hunter From poemhunter.com
Why had the people gathered a year before? Leaping at the sun signifies trying to do what is impossible or termed impossible. The sun implies the most difficult object to attain. If the patriot had desired sun from the sky, the people would have brought it or they would have answered that to bring sun, moon and stars from the sky is not difficult task for them.
