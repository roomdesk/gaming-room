There’s also a way to play xbox one games on the pc even without the xbox app. On xbox one, you’ll no longer be able to access your games with gold titles if you cancel your subscription. However, if you decide to renew your subscription at any time, you’ll be able to access and play your previously redeemed games with gold titles again. If you have an xbox live account, you can also play select titles on the pc without the console.
