The majority of ice crystals are hexagonal, the met office says, and the most common angle for a halo is around 22 degrees.

The halo affect was caused by ice crystals reflecting or re. Tiny ice crystals in earth�s atmosphere create the halos. It is caused usually by moisture in the higher part of the atmosphere but other halo effects can be caused by moisture lower down in the atmosphere. Sunlight through the ice crystals causes the light to split, or be refracted.

<p>Its form is a ring with an apparent radius of approximately 22° around the sun or moon. It’s caused by the reflection, and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin, wispy, high altitude cirrus. If you were looking at the sky today and saw a ring around the sun, you were seeing a high cloud. The rainbow, often called a halo, is caused by refraction and reflection of light from ice crystals.</p>
