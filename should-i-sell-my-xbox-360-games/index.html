<p>The xbox 360 can use up to 32gb of a flash drive, so that should have no problem holding your save games (i got my 360 in 2009, and all of my saves take up 1gb at most). But if they�re mostly new or only a year or two old, plus all the xbox original games, i would sell it for a little higher value.
