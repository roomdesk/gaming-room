<p>343 should focus on infinite first. Halo 3 looks good enough. To be fair, a halo 3 remaster likely wouldn�t be handled by 343, like halo 2 anniversary was (was made by saber interactive). It just has a smaller more limited map pool, and splits the community.</p>

<p>Will be replacing alot of halo 3 assets with newer games assets that fit the art style, like halo infinite and h2a assets.

<p>Like h2a there will be a remaster of halo 3 mp. There have been no story or gameplay changes to the original releases.

<p>Because they only updated the original xbox titles. Halo 3 has a lot better graphics and the likes than the first two games, as it should have, it�s on an entirely new and more powerful platform.
