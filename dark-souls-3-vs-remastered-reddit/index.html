Recenze Dark Souls Remastered Zing From zing.cz
The original released for the playstation 3 back in 2009 and was followed up by dark souls two years later in 2011. I�d play it first if i were you. Elden ring adds a new group password system that seems like it�ll support clans and dedicated pvp. The most noticable thing between dark souls 1 and 3 is the speed at which you and enemies perform attacks.
