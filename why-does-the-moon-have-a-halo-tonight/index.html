What makes a halo around the sun or moon? Space EarthSky From earthsky.org
The rainbow or halo around the moon appears due to the ice and dust particles from the atmosphere. A blood moon is a member of a lunar tetrad set; A lunar halo goes by many different names. A lunar halo is caused by the refraction, reelection, and dispersion of light in ice particles suspended within thin, wispy, high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds.

<p>It is the result of the moonï¿½s light being refracted by ice crystals in cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere at an altitude of approximately 6000 meters (20 000 feet). Another phenomenon that can lead to a ring forming around the sun or the moon is the corona. What causes a moon halo? Lunar halos are actually caused by thin, wispy, cirrus and cirrostratus.</p>

<p>The refraction of the light off the ice crystals creates a halo of light with an apparent radius of approximately 22Â° around the moon. The ice crystals both refract and reflect light, and if you are viewing the sun or moon from a certain angle, this will manifest as a ring or halo with a radius of about 22 degrees around the sun or moon, according to earthsky. The phase lasts about 7 days with the moon becoming more illuminated each day until the full moon. Minor lunar standstill and Hunterï¿½s Moon Astronomy.</p>
