Need for Speed Most Wanted (Xbox 360, 2005) eBay From ebay.ie
I�ve had to send my xbox 360 in to be repaired, and it should be on its way back this week. The xbox 360 can use up to 32gb of a flash drive, so that should have no problem holding your save games (i got my 360 in 2009, and all of my saves take up 1gb at most). Meaning that you can give gamestop your 5 360 games and you can get 1 or 2 xbox one game(s) to take home. A scuffed, dirty, well used xbox 360 slim e will sell for $25, where as a good condition console with all of the accessories will go for well over $100.
