<p>Because halo is really bad compared to most fps like cod and cs go. The first several forerunner levels with the arbiter look like total crap. Not so realistic its like battlefield, but no so toonish like it is now and i think halo 4 has come the closest. This version of MJOLNIR Rogue looks better than the.</p>

<p>More to it than just that but thats the main issue with the 4/5 one. What i said earlier in this post — how i feel about how cortana looks in the opening cutscene for halo 5 — applies to how cortana looks throughout the rest of halo 5: The gameplay is alright sure, but when i’m actively hating the story being told through said gameplay it doesn’t really make for a good halo campaign.
