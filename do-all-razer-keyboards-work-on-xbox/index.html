Other razer keyboards will work only as basic input devices with no other control for lighting. The razer turret and corsair k63 are the only wireless keyboards that work with the console. Razer is a completely different company. However, if the mouse or keyboard supports the wireless connection, they will also work.

<p>Yes, to connect the razer blackwidow elite keyboard to your console youï¿½ll need to purchase a usb wireless dongle which goes into the usb port of your console. Once that is connected, switch on the keyboard following the manufacturerï¿½s instructions and you should be good to go. You donât need to design them specifically for xbox, but any mouse and keyboard with a usb connection will work for us. If you donï¿½t have that option, 500hz should work fine.</p>
