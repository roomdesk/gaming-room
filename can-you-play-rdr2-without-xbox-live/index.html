<p>The xbox live gold requirement for red dead online is currently in place, but it is included with the xbox game pass, so you can play it. Looks fine to me.and dont wait a year to get an xbox one when the next generation of consoles isnt that far away, if you�re goinna wait that long might as we wait until the next xbox comes out which i�m sure will be backwards compatible.but i play on a one s and even without the highest graphical settings it still runs great and looks beautiful. Even if you use your pc, you still need to pay for internet access on your computer to play the game online. Buy Red Dead Redemption 2 Switch Nintendo.</p>
