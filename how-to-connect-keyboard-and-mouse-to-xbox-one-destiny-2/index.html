I’ve played on xbox most of my destiny lifetime, switched over to pc for the last year, but now i want to come back to xbox and play with my friends, but want to know if xbox d2 supports mouse and keyboard or not.

It’s not the cleanest setup in the world, and it doesn’t work with every game, but compared to the competition, it’s both the easiest in terms of setup and the widest available game support.
