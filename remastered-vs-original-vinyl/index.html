THE ROLLING STONES Goats Head Soup Super Deluxe Edition From vinyl.com.au
The original sounds a bit harsh and her voice is a tad laid back, when comparing. In the case of the cd version, the result is the same but in a better quality (digital master, pressed into a digital support). Digital audiophiles should get remastered albums from hd tracks, where the ardent and skillful work of engineers like katz can be appreciated, and sometimes sound superior to vinyl. The variances could be from the sourcing of the masters, the packaging, and even the thickness and type of vinyl used.
