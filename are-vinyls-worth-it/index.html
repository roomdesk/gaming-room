<p>I would advise you to buy a record you are familiar with in vinyl, go to a hifi store and listen to their stuff to see where you end up financially. Vinyl maintains its value while producing great sound and experience for its listeners. Vinyls have a caracteristic soubd, and beside that, if you�re used to listen in cd or in front of the computer(or both), and then you sit in a different place listening too a different media, you�ll have a different feel; How much vinyl records are worth is obviously dictated by how much people are willing to pay for it.</p>
