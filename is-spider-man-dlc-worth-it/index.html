<p>To me, it was completely worth it. It’s hard to say i like it more than the base game because obviously it’s so much shorter, but i really enjoy it. So while the story and missions aren’t the best, it’s still worth it if you really loved the base game. SpiderMan Game Of The Year Edition Announced Why It�s.</p>
