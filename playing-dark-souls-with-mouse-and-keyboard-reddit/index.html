<p>If there is a way to make the jump control the same as in ds1 and ds3 i would actually try to. I�ve only been playing dark souls 2 for 11 hours or so, and for the first 5 hours i was dying way too much because i didn�t know what all the keybinds were. I know there are mods but i have no clue how to find/get them to work. You might find the combat slow and clunky, or be annoyed by the boss runbacks, for example.</p>
