Despite this time gap, halo infinite is the intended next edition to the series, meaning there isn�t another game in between that players are missing. Yes, it�s a continuation and a sequel, but the game will feel like a fresh start. It’s still funny to me that halo infinite seems like a direct story sequel to halo wars 2 instead of halo 5.</p>
