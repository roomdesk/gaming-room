As in the ferrari f50, the rocket’s engine and transmission are stressed members, goodwood reports, for sharper handling. Basically, an f1 cooling system is the same as in any regular road car, as engine coolant and oil is pumped through a radiator to cool down before completing another cycle through the engine.</p>
