Do Not Underestimate ArtFX&#43; Statue of Petty Officer John117 From news.entertainmentearth.com
In halo infinite, master chief is wearing gen 3 armor, made after humanity has become well acquired with hardlight weaponry. Don�t get me wrong i like mc how he is, i was just generally curious whether or not the customization also extended to the campaign. This made the armor one of a kind to both chief and cortana, but something that i�m curious about is how far into cortana�s rampancy did she start tampering with chief�s armor? And i dont see how they would change the armor since he was aboard the ship in cyro sleep after halo 3 and seemingly woke up from an uninterrupted sleep in halo 4.
