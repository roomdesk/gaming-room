Does Keyboard And Mouse Work On Xbox One Minecraft LAMAWART From lamawart.blogspot.com
I�m not sure if wireless keyboards with an rf usb dongle worked on xbox 360 (logitech wireless usb receiver for keyboards and mice), but if it did, then it should work with xbox one too. When im plaing on my keybaord and mouse, they sometimes temporarily stop working. Kodi does work on xbox one you just have to use the xbox controller. This means that your system should recognize your peripherals as soon as you plug them into your console.
