The move controllers are the most prominent example, but the ps4 is also compatible. Sony are rumored to release more information about the ps5 next week though, so hopefully we’ll know soon enough about the status of ps4 games compatibility. So i am going to playstation but i want know if the ps5 will be backwards compatible with ps4 cause there are so many games on ps4 that i would love to play. Yes i have the xbox one but i am switching to playstation for the single player.
