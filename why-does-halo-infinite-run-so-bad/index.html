Halo 4 PC review Satisfying conclusion to the Master From neowin.net
To describe it, scoped aim and hip aim feel like they�re on different aim mechanics and i can never track like i can in any other halo. I played halo infinite multiplayer and the experience was genuinely depressing. Hopefully some of these solutions will help eliminate your fps woes in halo infinite and help make the game run a little better on pc. The graphics look nothing like the old halo.

<p>This is a simple issue: There should be an option to turn off antialiasing but there isn�t, and i would be so upset if the antialiasing was good and well designed but it makes the quality of the game blurry and not detailed, and upon that it decreases the quality of the resolution.

<p>Halo infinite feels like the first act in a much larger game that doesn’t currently exist.

<p>Having played every game in the franchise for 17 years, i was gutted that not only did the game not feel like halo, but the aiming is also awful.

<p>Why is it still so bad at this stuff? The game doesn�t even look that amazing, especially compared to the likes of fh5 which gets a smooth 60+ fps at all times on pretty much any hardware. Feels like halo 5 aim but worse. Search toilets Memes on me.me.</p>
