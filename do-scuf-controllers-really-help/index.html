Scuf PS5 pro controller which one is right for you? From dailyreadlist.com
That said i have had 2 scuf controllers myself and i have never had issues with the first one but the other arrived broken. Scuf is a brand name that has long existed in the realm of console esports, often the controller of choice for competitive players and with some of the biggest names in games such as call of duty, halo and fortnite using their controllers and even having their own designs. All controller thumbsticks are made of rubber components that can degrade over time. I personally say no, and i�ll explain why lil bit later.
