<p>Every weapon in bioshock 2 is more impressive and more satisfying than its equivalent in bioshock 1. I do appreciate bioshock 2 especially for it�s imo more fleshed out combat, but the constant crashes in remastered version and overly tanky big sisters did put me a bit off especially on higher difficulties, but disregarding those issues it�s a really good game.
