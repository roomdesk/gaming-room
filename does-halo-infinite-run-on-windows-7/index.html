How to run Halo Combat Evolved on Windows 7/8 Page 2 From pcgamer.com
Thats what they did with halo 2, giving a reason to buy win vista. Then i tried to uninstall halo infinite, and repair and reset gaming services, i then opened xbox app to redownload halo infinite, it asked me to download gaming services, and came up with a button to download it, i pressed it and it seemed to download fine. Problem is cdpr doesn’t care what os you run, ms however does, that’s the simple reason why this doesn’t run. It’s been years since i did it and i had windows 7 at the time so it is doable on an os other than windows vista.
