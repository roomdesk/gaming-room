<h3 id="why-does-the-master-chief-still-wear-the-mark-vi-armor">Why Does The Master Chief Still Wear The Mark Vi Armor?</h3><p>Mjolnir armor is a technological marvel, but can only be deployed to spartan units, because, regular soldiers do not have the strength or.

I hope 343i makes some kind of canonical excuse to change his armor; What armor does master chief wear in halo infinite?</p>

You can obviously see a change. Master chief is back to sporting a more classic look in halo infinite, and while the design of his armor is inspired by the bungie era of halo,.
