<p>Controller players, though, have the fabled aim assist. Apex legends� controller aim assist is back on the table at respawn. Controller on the other hand is pretty easy to pick up but it’s still a skill gap. Pros are Combining Controller and Mouse and Keyboard, But.</p>

<p>Chances are if you’re a console apex player you’ve probably heard the argument that playing with a mouse and keyboard is just so much “better” than. Controller players, though, have the fabled aim assist. As a former console player, the reason for aim assist is because a controller aims with your thumb while a mouse uses your entire hand.

<p>I can tell anyone, apex legends with a controller on pc with high fps, is super easy. Apex legends� controller aim assist is back on the table at respawn. You can still practice elements of a game such as team strategy, positioning, or other nitbits that help to define a specific game’s competitive meta.

<p>Controller players, though, have the fabled aim assist. There�s a lot of positioning/strategy will get you far (and is prob why the halo players were doing good), but there is definitely an aim advantage for mouse/keyboard as well as some movements that are damn near impossible on controller, that are easy on pc. It takes more muscle memory with all the keys you have. Controller vs Keyboard and Mouse Which is BETTER? w/ Call.</p>

<p>At longer ranges, controllers are inferior to a connected mouse even with the aim assist function. At shorter ranges, aim assist improves the aiming significantly and makes the controller at least equal. Keyboard and mouse is definitely harder to learn.

I�m under the impression that the worst controller players are better than the worst keyboard and mouse players and the best keyboard and mouse players are better than the best controller players. A controller is limited in many ways, but it’s really noticeable when trying to loot or perform any action with any quickness. As a former console player, the reason for aim assist is because a controller aims with your thumb while a mouse uses your entire hand.</p>

Console and pc players looking to jump into fortnite for the first time have the option of using a controller or hooking up a mouse and keyboard to their systems. You can still practice elements of a game such as team strategy, positioning, or other nitbits that help to define a specific game’s competitive meta.
