<p>Halo infinite developers 343 industries have not included playable elites in any of its halo games since it took control of the franchise with halo 4. Developer 343 industries held a fan q&amp;a, in which a number of questions were answered by members of the team. We do know infinite is going to be the ‘platform’ for all future halo content to come. I think no playable elites in infinite aren�t a big deal discussion at first i was a bit confused why 343 would decide not to add them as playable characters when they mentioned going in a different direction with the multiplayer in a prior interview but now i honestly think playable elites would be slightly out touch in this vibrant.</p>
