Reddit Ps5 External Hard Drive REDITU From reditu.blogspot.com
My dream is to play cold war 120 fps with a 1440p monitor in my ps5. The benq ew3280u is perfect for ps5 with 4k 60hz, ips, hdr, dual hdmi, displayport, superb audio, and of course wide color gamut coverage. The actual signal being outputted by the ps5 will still be 4k (or 1080p if not on a 4k tv). So, in their view, there�s no reason for them to have the ps5 support 1440p either.
