<h3 id="they-do-it-by-refracting-and-reflecting-the-light">They Do It By Refracting And Reflecting The Light.</h3><p>The term “halo” usually implies a ring, and circular halos around the sun (and moon) are common.

Water droplets can do the same, producing a smaller but more colourful halo. Reflections from the water surface. The ice crystals in the clouds refract the incoming light coming from the sun.</p>

That is, the halo is seen when you�re facing the sun, with its light passing through the cloud; When at just the right angle, it causes us to see the halo. However, on the exposure, that halo became darker than the surrounding sky rather than lighter.</p>
