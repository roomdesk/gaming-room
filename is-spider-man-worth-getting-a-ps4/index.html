<p>I played spiderman on ps4 and i loved it and while there were some improvements in ps5 version, its not a huge enough leap to justify replay. Miles morales will be released on november 12 as we mentioned earlier. The character development is crazy good, the story (although short) is really good, and the bioelectricity takedowns are great for photo mode. So while the story and missions aren’t the best, it’s still worth it if you really loved the base game.</p>
