<p>With challenges the problem is that once you�re in season 2 (and stop getting lvl points) there is no point doing any challenges that don�t give points because xp is (now) useless. I remember getting them every time i levelled up when reach initially launched but maybe it just felt that way because the levels fly by super fast in the early levels. You earn one season point.
