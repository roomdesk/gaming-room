On ebay, the current pricing for a peace bear with tag errors is just over $26.00. Like other beanie babies, snort can be worth even more if he has an oddity. If it’s the beanie baby it can be worth between $50 and $1000 depending on condition of the tag, generation of the tag, and the condition of the beanie baby. Beanie babies with this tag will also have either a 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation swing tag.
