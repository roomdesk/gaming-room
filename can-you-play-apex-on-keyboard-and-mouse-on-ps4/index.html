<p>I hope i am not the only one that wants keyboard compatibility for apex legends on ps4 because its a lot of fun and it has so much to offer like the amazing mobility and it be soo awesome to be able to play the game on my ps4 with a mouse and keyboard since it would hit a larger community of players and would increase the player count. Apex legends players were apparently able to play the game using keyboard and mouse on consoles giving them an unfair advantage. I remember you could do that with fortnite as well when it first came out, but they eventually made those kb/m players play on pc servers because people were complaining about it.
