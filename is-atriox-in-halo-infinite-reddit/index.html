<p>Halo infinite developers 343 industries have not included playable elites in any of its halo games since it took control of the franchise with halo 4. 31.9m members in the gaming community. Now that we�ve had a chance to experience the latest chapter in master chief�s saga, we�re sure many of you have been left with a number of questions, such as just who the endless are, what exactly happened to atriox, and above all, just what in the 7 rings is happening in that legendary. Here’s my sloppily put together Halo Infinite poster halo.</p>

<p>While escharum was the one in the halo infinite gameplay demo, he�s not the true leader of the banished. The banished are the main faction in halo wars 2, and are similar to the former covenant, with a mix of species, such as grunts, elites, jackals brutes and hunters. The banished are acting like they did something right because they ended up with a higher amount of assets and personnel on the ground after the clusterfuck they. I�m beginning to think this official halo outpost art may.</p>

<p>But unlike the covenant, the banished are led by a powerful brute called atriox. Looks like we�re back to relying on toy leaks for consistent news on infinite, but this time it�s much more detailed than the standard mega construx stuff, at least. Are all new mysteries that are going to be pivotal in the next few halo infinite campaigns. Cutter VS. Atriox halo.</p>

<p>It really did feel like there was a game missing between halo 5 and infinite,. But i think in order to not clutter the story and not have them be bland characters like in halo 5 that brought nothing to the table, them having their own dlc would be the best.

<p>I don�t think any of the books do much for setting up halo infinite other than establishing why atriox isn�t on the ark. It’s possible that atriox was killed in the time between halo wars 2 and halo infinite, but an offscreen death seems like a very anticlimactic end. The stuff with harbinger, the endless, the atriox story, etc. Halo Infinite teaser suggests The Banished enemies Polygon.</p>

Personally i think hes alive, just since his ship at the ark is destroyed he has no way to communicate with his. Based on what i saw in halo infinite, cortana and chief had an undeniable bond.</p>
