Why I hate… Halo • From asw.mymom.info
Following the release of halo 3, bungie announced it was splitting off from mic. They�re the same people who make halo and destiny. However, many fans are now wondering if the deal will make halo a playstation exclusive. Well why didn�t microsoft just form/give halo to 343 and let bungie make destiny as a first party ip.

<p>Man this is messed up there quitting because the first 2 games sucked,hey i mea everygame has its faults if i were bungie if one of my games sucked i would hve learned my mistake and try to make the next halo game better. Bungie split from microsoft in 2007, shortly after the release of halo 3 for the xbox 360. Even so, the company still developed two more games for microsoft, all halo affairs. Furthermore, why did bungie decide to sell halo?.</p>

<p>Halo infinite is owned by microsoft, along with all halo intellectual property, servers, and data. The developer company reportedly wished to expand its horizons int he gaming industry rather than being tied to a single franchise. The folks at bungie were ready to move on from halo by halo 3, and bungie corporation (which was actually a part of microsoft) wanted to get started working on new ip�s (destiny being one of them), but they were contractually obligated to create at least two more halo titles as their ticket to separate amicably.

<p>Bungie stepped away from halo and its publisher, microsoft, in 2007, in order to push forward in the industry rather than be tied to a. I believe one of the reasons they stopped developing halo is because bungie wanted to move on from the halo series and create another game.

<p>Well, that is not the case at all. Bungie developers wanted to create a game they could consistently update, and they wanted to be able to respond to players’ desires in real time.

<p>Well, that is not the case at all. Well why didn�t microsoft just form/give halo to 343 and let bungie make destiny as a first party ip. I believe one of the reasons they stopped developing halo is because bungie wanted to move on from the halo series and create another game. Why was Bungie�s message to the fans once again removed.</p>
