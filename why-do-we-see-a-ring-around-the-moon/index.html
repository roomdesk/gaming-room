<p>We always see the same side of the moon, because as the moon revolves around the earth, the moon rotates so that the same side is always facing the earth. A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The reason we can see the glowing outer edge of the sun at the maximum point of an annular eclipse is that it happens while the moon is near its farthest point from earth, called apogee , when the moon is smaller than. If you spot a halo, keep in mind that rings around the moon are mostly colorless, but you may notice more red on the inside and more blue on the outside of the halo.</p>
