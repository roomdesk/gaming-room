What Causes a Halo Around the Sun? From baynews9.com
(see ww2010�s website for diagrams that illustrate how it works.) A sun halo is caused by the refraction, reflection, and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin, wispy, high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Halos around the sun or moon are caused by high, thin cirrus clouds drifting high above your head. The clouds contain millions of tiny ice crystals, which refract, split and even reflect the light to give an impression of a circular.
