Should I get a PS4 Pro in 2020 before the PS5 comes out From androidcentral.com
The plan should be to play on my ps4 pro, initially. Not worth the ps5, for me. Furthermore, it will take at least two to three years into the life of ps5 before buying a ps4 pro becomes a waste of money, and by then, you�d most likely have saved up enough money to buy a ps5. If it is okay for you to play them later, after the ps5 comes out, then wait.

<p>For the love of god wait for the ps5. When ps5 will be released then there are high chances that the price of ps4 pro will be dropped, so you are in profit if you decide to buy ps4 pro. ^ what i would do, but it depends on your budget. You’ll always get a better deal if you wait, that’s just the nature of technology.</p>

<p>Just buy a ps4 pro, if you wait for the next console you would’ve already missed out on all of the awesomeness that the ps4 pro has had to offer. Buy a ps4 pro buy neither of them and wait for a ps5 if you only want to play exclusive ps4 titles and enjoy couch gaming with friends then buying a ps4 is the best option. There is no guarantee sony will even release a ps5 pro, as the ps5 is a massive new generational upgrade to the ps4 in every way possible, the ps4 pro came out in 2016, 2 years after the ps4 and the ps4 did not drop in price.
