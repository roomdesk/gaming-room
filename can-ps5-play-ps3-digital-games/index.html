<meta name="description" content="Awesome Can Ps5 Play Ps3 Digital Games With Best Lighting Ideas, Can i play ps3 games on the ps5? It�s unlikely that the ps5 will be able to play ps3 games in any way, especially considering the ps4 never saw backward compatibility of any kind.
Sony PS5 Slim a small and cheap game console Мир Смарт ТВ From iptvtv.ru
However, unlike the ps4, it looks like the console will still boot physical ps4 games. The ps5 is not backwards compatible with ps3 games, however it is backwards compatible with ps4 games, allowing for the play of select remasters on the ps5. The best thing to hope for would be some kind of improved system for ps now or some other digital distribution of ps3 titles. All ps5 games are available to purchase digitally from playstation store.
