<p>An arbiter is usually chosen or appointed by parties or by a court on their behalf. The supreme court consists of the chief justice of the united states and such number of associate justices as may be fixed by congress. The supreme court is the final arbiter, they can create law, and only they can determine constitutionality. The judiciary is not the final arbiter on the constitution.</p>
