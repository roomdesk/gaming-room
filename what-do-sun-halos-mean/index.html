There was a rainbow halo around the sun yesterday From reddit.com
When you see a halo around the sun, that is an indicator that there is moisture high in the atmosphere. Moon haloes are formed when moonlight is refracted in ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Sundogs, light pillars, and other kinds of halos seen in the sky are atmospheric phenomena that occur when light is reflected or refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds.
