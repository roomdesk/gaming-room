Is Apex Legends CrossPlay? From gamingesports.com
Adapters, like the xim keyboard and mouse adapter, trick the console into believing that a controller is being used. With the xim adapter, it is possible to connect peripherals from various manufacturers directly to the microsoft home console. While some games support keyboard and mouse directly, like neverwinter, smite and tera, apex legends is not one of them. Making your gaming mouse and keyboard compatable would definatly open up a wider variety of skill levels and introduce more players into your game.
