Top Stories Do You Need Xbox Live For Fortnite Live From secondinfo.github.io
I cancelled my xbox live gold subscription because my dad didn’t want to pay for xbox live gold and game pass anymore, i looked up that there is another xbox live that is free. Unfortunately for xbox one owners, this is the one platform that requires an online subscription to play apex legends. Every online experience game on xbox requires gold as opposed to playstation where free mp games don’t require playstation plus (or whatever their service is called) can confirm apex and fortnite and stuff are free on ps4. You can also visit the apex legends microsoft store page to add the game to your account, though you�ll need to have your xbox one as one of the linked devices attached to your microsoft account.
