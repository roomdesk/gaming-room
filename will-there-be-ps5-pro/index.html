The PS5 Pro would be released at the same time as the PS5 From gizchina.com
By these timelines, we can probably expect a ps5 pro console in 2023. But for 8k, there wont be a big enough jump to dedicate an advanced ps5 pro system around and most people wont own 8k sets as 4k is good enough until 2030. Jermaine smit smit�s streamlined ps5 pro render sit somewhere between an older concept he cooked up last year for the ps5 slim, and the actual ps5. At the moment, we have no confirmation that sony is working on a ps5 pro.
