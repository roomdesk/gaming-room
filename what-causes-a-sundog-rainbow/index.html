What causes a rainbow around the sun?bottom line: Cirrus are high, thin, wispy clouds made up mostly of flat hexagonal ice crystals. A sundog is a concentrated patch of sunlight occasionally seen about 22° to the left or right of the sun. Both rainbows and sundogs are formed by moisture filtering the sunlight.

<p>Sundogs appear when sunlight hits clouds of ice crystals and the ice acts as prisms. The sun dog is a member of the family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. The tiny ice and water droplet sizes cause sunlight to be diffracted—it is obstructed by the droplets, is bent, and spreads out into its spectral colors.

<p>Sometimes, a pair of sundogs will appear—one on the sun�s left, and another on. They are located approximately 22 degrees either left, right, or both, from the sun, depending on where the ice crystals are present.
