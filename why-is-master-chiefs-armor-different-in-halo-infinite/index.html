Infinite Earths Halo Master Chief ARTFX Statue and Mark V From iearths.blogspot.ca
Spartans are infamous for the imposing figures they strike in their armor, and it�s that armor that provides players with the greatest amount of customization in halo infinite. Our explanation to why chief�s armor changed between 3 and 4 was because cortana redesigned it while he was in cryosleep. Which makes sense as far as the lore goes. Infinite, the best looking we�ve seen since halo 3, and i�m wondering if 343 will finally break it�s tradition of withholding the chief�s armor for campaign.
