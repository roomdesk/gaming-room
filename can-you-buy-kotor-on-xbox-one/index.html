The Best Xbox One Games You Can Buy in Spring 2015 From gottabemobile.com
So by now we�ve all heard that the original kotor is now backward compatible for xbox one, which i�m super excited about. Was playin both of them the other day xd. However, when i accessed the xbox store (via my xbox), i saw the game wasn�t available to purchase and download directly. It would encourage more people to play this game i think as i have heavily enjoyed both 1 and 2 on xbox for hundreds of hours on each game.
