<p>After playing gtav on 360, then getting it on xbox one and playing with a controller (and hating the way 1st person works on a controller) i may give 1st person a go properly with keyboard and mouse. Here, you can learn some keyboards and mice that can be used on xbox. Iï¿½m sure it really doesnï¿½t help that iï¿½m using a blue switch mechanical keyboard, but i canï¿½t see it getting much better, it just feels so clunky and imprecise. Bioshock infinite was the first one i could think of, where just pressing a button on the controller would make it be in control, then pressing a button on the keyboard would give it back to the keyboard.</p>

<p>Use a keyboard and mouse on ps4 &amp; xbox one! With the controller you get analogue triggers, and i know you can play the game and have it auto switch, but thats crazy long, picking up a controller everytime you enter a vehicle then dropping it when you leave. Two people answer this question, one said you can connect directly but it wonât work that way. Download GTA 5 Game Highly Compressed for PC Free.</p>

<p>Can you play gta 5 with mouse and keyboard on ps4?
