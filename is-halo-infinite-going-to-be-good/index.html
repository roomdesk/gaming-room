Halo Infinite would have come out earlier if Halo 5 wasn�t From vg247.com
The mp and campaign are good. I don’t really understand what’s going on with the story, so i don’t know how that aspect is going to work, but i now have a fair bit of confidence that halo infinite is going to be a good game and will finally see the playstation 5 getting some serious competition. If you skipped halo 5 because you heard bad things and/or have never touched a halo wars game, halo infinite is going to be as disorienting for you. But the game right now is very, very good and with everything cd projekt have planned it’s going to get even better.

<p>Give me good halo levels and a smattering of smaller challenges that engage with the gunplay and i’ll be extremely happy. But they were an asset for custom games and machinima makers. Now that the multiplayer for halo infinite has been available to play for free for almost two weeks we can safely say that this is the best. Lastly, halo infinite doesn’t feel the same as other shooters.</p>

<p>The strongest piece of evidence that suggests the flood may be in halo infinite is the fact that, based on numerous hints from the trailers, the game is very likely taking place on installation 07.
