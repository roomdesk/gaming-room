Metro Last Light Redux Screenshots Image 1499 XboxOne From xboxone-hq.com
Metro 2033 redux is the enhanced version of original game metro 2033, which was released on march 2010. Snes_64_dc_xbox 7 years ago #6. I played in normal ranger mode in these playthroughs and i think this is the way these games should be played, it wasn’t as hard as i thought it would be and not having the hud just made the games more immersive, there is one difference between the ranger mode in these games, in 2033 you can see your bullets by holding a button and your health doesn’t. So if you wanna go sequentially it�s still 2033 and then last light, both as redux (s) if your computer (or console) can run it.
