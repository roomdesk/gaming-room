How To Share Xbox Live Gold With 2 Consoles Xbox Live From goldiphonecase4884.blogspot.com
Hi everyone, so i just got off a live chat with microsoft and i asked them if it was possible to have two xbox one in the same household for my brother and i and only having one of our accounts have the xbox live gold subscription and be able to share it to the other console as well. Xbox live gold memberships can be shared with each other as well, since enabling game sharing will also allow both accounts to access live gold benefits. How do i share my xbox live gold with 3 consoles? To my understanding, if the xbox that is set as your home console has active live gold, any xbox live account that signs in on it will have shared access to all the content.
