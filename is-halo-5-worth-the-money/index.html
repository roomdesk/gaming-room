No, use the exact same amount of money to get gamepass for a month, and use gamepass to play through it once along with plenty of other games. Yes it has a lot of flaws right now, but even with the high ping and matchmaking problems i would still pay full price for infinite. Halo 5 hands down offers the better value for money in terms of content but both are different enough to be appreciated for what they bring to the genre. When i play solo i prefer heroic, but when i am going through for story i lower it to normal and blast through.
