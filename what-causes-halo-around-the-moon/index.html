<p>The lunar halo or ring around the moon is caused by the reflection and refraction of light from ice crystals that are suspended at high altitudes. Lunar halos are actually caused by thin, wispy, cirrus and cirrostratus. When at just the right angle, it causes us to see the halo. The same thin clouds can cause a ring, or halo, around the moon at night.</p>
