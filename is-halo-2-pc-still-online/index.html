How many hours is halo 2? Spartan assault arrived on steam. Support ended for halo 2 on 10/9/2012.not for sure if that affected the achievements, since they all require online.but i bought it today, tried to install it, and it would not let me connect. I have no idea if the servers are still being run or if there are any people even on.
