Change the game at the top to grand theft auto iv, then set your name up in tools&gt;launcher settings, then set your exe path in tools&gt;game settings to gtaiv.exe in your game�s main directory. Can you play gta iv with friends? I hated the gtaiv multiplayer, it just didn�t have that hectic gta feel compared to the single player. Now you can join a server.
