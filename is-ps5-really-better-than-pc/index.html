<p>If it�s a fast paced fps type game, pc all the way (also for mouse/keyboard). While it’s obvious that gaming pcs are superior both graphically and performance wise, you might just want to consider the playstation 5 (ps5) if what you are looking for is the best value for your money.

<p>This could even be achieved before the arrival of the next console. Upgrading a gaming pc is also easier since the nature of pcs allows you to buy new components later down the line and use them to upgrade your system, while if you want to upgrade a console, you have to wait for a new version to be released.
