<p>Halo infinite is very much a skilled based game. Master chief is back in action baby! I am playing on a i5 6600k (oc to 4.3 ghz) and a r9 3080x (wich is technically too bad for the game) and 8gb or ram so i know that i cant expect miracles in performance. Navigate to the compatibility tab, and check the box next to “run this program as an administrator.”.</p>
