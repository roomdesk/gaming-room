<p>Its not the main issue of 60 fps man , main issue is many fights or places in the game drop you to 40 fps , game would be fine if its stuck at 60 but thats not the case and we know elden ring is open world so its more likely to loss more frames than other soulsborne game as they are in smaller scale , thats why all mmorpg in games in general have fps unlock Elden ring limited to 60fps, ps5 &amp; xbox series x ray tracing confirmed bandai namco has confirmed elden ring will support up to 60fps gameplay and feature ray tracing on ps5 and xbox series x|s consoles. Even though i have a decent gaming pc and the price tag will be higher, iï¿½ll be playing this on my ps5 hopefully with haptic feedback support as all the souls type gamesï¿½ combat lends itself very well to controller so no need for k&amp;m.

<p>Hope itï¿½s full 4k and 60fps on the ps5 though. Elden ring will not reach 4k natives (2160p) with 60 fps on ps5/xsx, it will be able to reach 1440p/1800p which is what sekiro does (with rescaled at 4k) and most games to keep 60fps. Elden ring will probably work at 60fps on ps5 / xsx, but do you think it will work at 4k too? Elden Ring Will Seemingly Feature 4K and 60 FPS Support on.</p>
