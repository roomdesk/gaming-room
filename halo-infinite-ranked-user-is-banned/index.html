This was definitely one of my best games. halo From reddit.com
Why do i get the user is banned message in ranked in halo infinite? I then go back to playing and it just says user is banned whenever i try to play ranked. This is absolutely depressing, this game gives so much damn joy and it�s the best game i have played in years. Having bugs is common for any game, especially if that game has been out quite recently.
