How to download GTA 5 on Android PLAY GTA 5 on Android From youtube.com
So i have 2 accounts that already have gta v, one bought at steam and one from rockstar directly, but if i want to try play the game with rockstar account it says play on steam so i can only use the steam account not cant the rockstar one, so how do i play it at. To not waste any more of my available data (i get 1000mb a month) i immediately turn of tethering and play the game. To set the launch options in properties, click “set launch options”. The last few days ive been playing gta v through steam by using my iphone to tether to my pc and start steam in online mode and after that starting gta v (as i think you know, gta v requires an internet connection to start).
