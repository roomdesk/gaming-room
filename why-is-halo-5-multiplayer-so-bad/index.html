<p>Halo fans aren�t unadapatable the things you pointed out, sprinting, ads, and movement abilities, are largely viewed as a negative because they clash with map and gameplay ideologies.

<p>Everything in halo 5 has to be designed to work around. Halo has many flaws, it�s just that a huge percentage of what made it special at the time is now baked into the dna of modern shooters, so it just seems to be a combination of good music, some ok levels, and then all its flaws. Halo 2 came out while those people were still in school. Why We Said Halo 5�s Competitive Multiplayer Is More.</p>
<h3 id="with-a-very-limited-amount-of-servers-for-halo-5-unless-most-players-will-have-a-huge-disadvantage-because-they-dont-live-as-close-to-the-server">With A Very Limited Amount Of Servers For Halo 5 Unless Most Players Will Have A Huge Disadvantage Because They Don’t Live As Close To The Server.</h3><p>The reason halo 5 failed? What’s your honest opinions about the game here is my thoughts why the game is so bad because it has a lack of content what do i mean about that is most of the things are in multiplayer instead of the campaign like all the weapons and abilities are not in the campaign if you think about it compare that to the previous halo games even worst about this game is it’s a pay to win I don�t think you can fully appreciate it outside of it�s historical context, tbh. The maps are dense and the routes through them are complicated by the movement abilities.</p>
<h3 id="by-odst-and-reach-the-people-in-college-at-halo-1-were-now-leaving-but-they-still-had-time-for-some-halo">By Odst And Reach, The People In College At Halo 1 Were Now Leaving, But They Still Had Time For Some Halo.</h3><p>The multiplayer is great and feels fresh and new, while keeping the feel of halo in tacked. Not the gameplay, but rather the players and matchmaking. The best player in the game would have to stick with a speed boost, while the worst player could end up with a sniper. That game was released in a criminally broken state, with eager fans having to wait weeks before the server issues that plagued the launch were finally fixed.</p>
<h3 id="you-said-you-can039t-do-halo-2-and-3-because-they-are-unbalanced-but-then-you-had-fun">You Said You Can�t Do Halo 2 And 3 Because They Are Unbalanced But Then You Had Fun.</h3><p>Hopefully now that they have a solid multiplayer foundation and a lot of feedback about halo 5�s campaign, halo 6 will see more even development on both fronts. Halo 4 has a great campaign but a poor multiplayer, while halo 5 has a great multiplayer but a poor campaign (for the record, i loved halo 4’s multiplayer; Halo 5 had a good balance for the hardcore being developed in hand with pro�s but was awful at appealing to casuals with its garbage attempt at massive multiplayer matches aka warzone leaving whats its really memorably for 8v8 to die. The chemistry with chief and cortana was outstanding.</p>
