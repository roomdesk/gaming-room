<p>I understand its emulating the intel architecture on a ppc platform but the raw power of the 360 should render it able to handle kotor 2 with ease. How does a game coded and optimized for the xbox lag on its successor? I�d go for kotor 2 as well. So by now we�ve all heard that the original kotor is now backward compatible for xbox one, which i�m super excited about.</p>
