How Halo Infinite WILL [probably] SHOCK US Cortana vs From youtube.com
That wasn�t the initial plan. i wonder if that�s a vague reference to 343 going back to the drawing board after fans completely hated halo 5�s campaign lol. During halo infinite, the blue team was tasked by captain lasky to take on a mission known as operation wolfie on october 7 th, 2559. Will blue team be in halo infinite? Assuming blue team will be in halo infinite, i hope they get gen 3 suits too, and are based more on the standard mkvi armor, like this.
