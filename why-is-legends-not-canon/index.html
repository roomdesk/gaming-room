<p>People may not get that star wars legends is no longer canon either because they have not heard about this new development, they may have heard it but do not believe it, or they simply don�t want to accept it because they�ve relied on it being canon material for so long.

<p>Rather than announcing the decanonization of the eu (after all, you can’t “decanonize” what was never canon to begin with), lucasfilm simply announced that the eu would be rebranded as legends, and from then on, all novels, comic books, video games, and television shows will be on the same level of canon as the films and the clone wars. Videos you watch may be added to the tv�s watch history and. They�re just dudes in armor in their clone wars cameo. BROLY IS CANON WHY NOT TURLES NOW Summons Dragon Ball.</p>

<p>Many of the books released after that date are legends, and even though swtor constantly gets new story, it does not follow that rule either.

After disney’s acquisition, it became part of the legends universe and completely lost its canon status.
