<p>It�s an interesting proposition given bungie�s relationship with microsoft, who purchased the studio back in 2000, spawning many successful halo games. I�m not particularly against microsoft getting bungie back into the series (tho in all honesty, the issue with 343i isn�t the actual talent, but the upper management so you�d be replacing a lot of quality graphic artists, programmers, level designers etc. Bungie.net is the internet home for bungie, the developer of destiny, halo, myth, oni, and marathon, and the only place with official bungie info straight from the developers.

<p>Microsoft obviously feels that halo is one of those console defining titles (and rightly so imo, i bought the original xbox way back when because i got the chance to play coop halo with a friend and fell madly in love) so they bought halo to ensure bungie didn�t do something crazy like release the game on the play station. The tru7h about mythdown many consider this mission to be even easier than reclaimer.perhaps because unlike the last mission, this one can be sped run since it doesn�t have all of the. I’d be shocked to see future games from bungie (that aren’t already in the works w/ signed contracts, if any) on xbox in the future. Bungie bids Halo farewell •.</p>

Joe staten was done with halo after halo reach regardless. It�s an interesting proposition given bungie�s relationship with microsoft, who purchased the studio back in 2000, spawning many successful halo games.
