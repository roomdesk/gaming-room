War Thunder Cross Play Gameplay (PC/PS4) YouTube From youtube.com
Sim battles are currently disabled for xbox, we don’t eta for its aviability. I play on xbox with k&amp;m and a lot of other xbox players do as well so if your reason for disabling crossplay is to get away from k&amp;m players you�re out of luck. Tried getting him to enable cross play between platforms in his xbox settings, he already had it on. Gaijin confirmed to wccftech that war thunder�s upcoming xbox one release will feature crossplay with pc (but not ps4 because of sony).
