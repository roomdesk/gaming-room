<p>With mouse and keyboard support on ps5, it’s easy to get around that issue. When it comes to mouse and keyboard support, the official word from sony is that they are not supported on the ps5 outside of certain compatible games. Using something like xim can let you use it but you�ll be stuck with controller recoil and it�ll be terribly clunky to aim. The problem is that destiny 2 has a go stop approach to the recognition of controller be it either on or off and its not an easy trick to disable the controller recognition while having it active and fully functional.</p>
