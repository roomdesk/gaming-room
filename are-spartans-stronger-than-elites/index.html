<p>Elites are stronger than an unarmored spartan, however much slower in regards to both speed and reaction time. Regularelites are roughly as strong or stronger than a spartan in mjolnir. Even their shields recharge faster and they donï¿½t need a health pack due to their health regenerating on their own. Strength of Spartans HaloStory.</p>

<p>If it just means ï¿½being better in general combatï¿½ then spartans are far far ahead of the average covenant warrior. Strength wise a mjolnir equipped spartan is stronger than most minor elites. The books have them be basically gods compared to the elites, being able to run twice as fast as ghosts, being able to dent titanium and rock with single blows, killing elites often in single blows.

<p>Elites are certainly capable, but not all are on the same level as a spartan, and some are even more capable than a spartan. Weï¿½ve all heard the news by now, in reach the elites are bigger, stronger, and faster than spartans. A spartan fighting an elite hand to hand was just spartanâs fighting dirty with quick strikes and even faster blocks the elites honestly couldnât keep up.

But if an elite goes through the same surgeries that a spartan goes through to make the spartan stronger, the elite would be the strongest. When comparing major elites or major brutes against spartans, choosing which is stronger might be difficult. Despite this, they are often weaker than brutes.</p>
