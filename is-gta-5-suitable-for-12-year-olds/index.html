Is Grand Theft Auto 4 Suitable For A 12 Year Old Grand From grand-theft-auto16.blogspot.com
This video aims to discuss the main points made by parents, game designers and children to decide whether or not gta. This game is fine for any mature 13 year old and up. Also the online player base is quite ott and rude so i�d be rather worried about that aspect. There are a few naughty and violent parts but in my opinion 100% of all ten year olds can handle grand theft auto4.
