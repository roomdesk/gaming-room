<p>It�s not a brand new game in any way, so i guess it depends on your budget and your inclination to replay crysis. The three crysis games still look great on modern pcs and are a lot fun, which raises the question if we really needed these remasters in the first place. The crysis remastered trilogy might have some flaws here and there, but it’s still well worth playing today, especially with the brand new quality of life improvements.
