<meta name="description" content="New Can Students Ride The Metro Bus For Free With New Design, Metro transit is implementing a pilot program that will let all elementary and high school students ride city buses for free for almost 13 months. Participants must use a student or college/vocational reduced fare tap card.
Lehigh University students, staff can now ride LANTA buses From lehighvalleylive.com
Metroaccess id card may ride metrobus and metrorail free of charge. Middle and high school students can pay with cash (on the bus only), and still receive their 50 percent discount using their student id card. Community advocates say that metro’s proposed pilot is an unacceptable reversal from its stated “moral obligation” to be free to all riders. Effective july 1, 2019, all montgomery county youth ages 18 and under ride free all the time on mcdot buses.
