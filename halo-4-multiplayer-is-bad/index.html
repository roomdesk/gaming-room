<p>I don�t think halo 4 is bad, per say. But from what we have seen so far, i think 343 has done pretty well. The refined and memorable campaign, the superb multiplayer, the score, the weapons, all of it went into making a game that truly stands out in the halo franchise. I�ve done the first seven missions and i feel like i�ve played through the exact same corridors from start to finish.</p>
