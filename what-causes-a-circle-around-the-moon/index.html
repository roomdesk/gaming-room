One of the moon’s most important effects on the earth is its large influence over our ocean tides. The moon formed around 4.5 billion years ago. Halos around the sun or moon are caused by high, thin cirrus clouds drifting high above your head. The ring, or halo effect, is caused by the refraction of sunlight through ice crystals in the upper atmosphere, around three to six miles above the earth.
