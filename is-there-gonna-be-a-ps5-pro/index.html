<p>I just don�t think a ps5pro is something that�s needed this gen. If you assume as per sony’s point of view, then you will able to see that there is no chance of releasing ps5 pro till the next three years.

<p>All generation iterations will always be following a current gen +1 format, with an eventual “slim” version and i’m guessing that they will probably continue to follow the. Now the ps5 is finally here, let’s have a think about when it will go away. Sony has already revealed the ps5 and the ps5: PS5 and Xbox Series X backwards compatibility is going to.</p>

<p>That part is just my personal opinion. Unfortunately for those hoping for something more subtle with the ps5, there are currently no plans for a slim model, and we doubt there will be for a.

<p>January 8, 2021 at 2:59 am. Assuming sony goes ahead with the ps5 pro, we wouldn’t expect it to launch until at least three years after the original ps5. That part is just my personal opinion. Everything We Know So Far About the PS5.</p>

<p>Ps5 pro in the next 2 years, that�s all insanity if there is any kind of pro system that happens for the ps5 we wont see that till at least… 2023 2021 + 2 = 2023? Sony’s number scheme is pretty much set in stone at this point. I�m pretty sure the next big bit of ps5 tech that�s gonna come out is gonna be the psvr2. is their going to be a ps5 Cover Gadget.</p>

<p>Also, according to the price of playstation 4 pro compared to ps4, the price of playstation 5 professional may be us $499.99 (the same as the coming ps5), or probably more than $499.99 (maybe $599.99). I just don�t think a ps5pro is something that�s needed this gen. Well it�s possible, but until sony says we are getting one then i don�t know.

<p>The lack of production of ps5�s and the fact that they are so hard to find also has me considering saving up and just building a gaming pc. If you assume as per sony’s point of view, then you will able to see that there is no chance of releasing ps5 pro till the next three years. Is there gonna be a ps5 pro?
