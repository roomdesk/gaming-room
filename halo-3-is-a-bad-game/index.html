Halo 3 ODST Was a Spin On Our Expectations of the Series From arcadesushi.com
Halo 3 is a tough game to play. Odst comes in at number five, and it�s not through any shortcomings of its own, it�s purely down to the excellence of the remaining four games. The first bad habbit i’d like to discuss is melee attacks. Much of the time is spent eradicating covenant forces.
