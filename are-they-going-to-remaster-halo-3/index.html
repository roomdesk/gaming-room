<p>There is no need to remaster halo 3. I love the game but those jpeg backgrounds in cutscenes are super in your face nowadays. Halo 3 was released in september 2007, so some people thought it would be fitting to release a remaster to celebrate the game�s 10th anniversary this year. OMG stop. There is no Halo 3 Anniversary.</p>

<p>For a nearly 10 year old game, halo 3 still holds up well due to the effects and lighting. The halo franchise is the backbone of xbox exclusives. Suffice to say it�s a lot of work and requires engine work too, not just art. Halo 3 ODST and Relic remake come to The Master Chief.</p>

<p>The only reason theres halo hype right now is because they’ve hinted at classic art style and gameplay. This is what i�m thinking. Character models and cutscenes do look a bit rough. Halo Reach PC Will Let You Disable Anticheat to Go AllIn.</p>

<p>It�s already looking fine with bungie�s artwork. Character models and cutscenes do look a bit rough.
