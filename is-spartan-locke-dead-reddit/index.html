Also agent locke is a weirdly specific name, when he�d normally be referred to as spartan locke. I know the megaconstrux sets should always be taken with a grain of salt, but there�s enough circumstantial evidence between this and what we see in infinite�s campaign to assume locke isn�t dead and is somewhere on zeta halo.

The following years saw locke leading fireteam osiris (the same team in halo 5. For the purposes of master chief‘s story those two things might as well be true.

<p>The inverse analysis — spartan locke�s death would be a pretty shocking moment in halo infinite, so it�s a shame that this toy leak had to spoil the plot point early. Unlike the close first round, the second round is a definitive victory for the master chief and his iconic spartan armor, with doomguy only getting in a few punches here and there. Prior to becoming a spartan, locke had risen to the rank of lieutenant. Halo Infinite Mega Bloks set potentially spoils major plot.</p>
