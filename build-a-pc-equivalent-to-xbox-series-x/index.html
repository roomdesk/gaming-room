Switching to PC Gaming From Console PS5 and Xbox Series X From youtube.com
Let’s break that down so it’s a more easily digestible bit of information rather than just a number. The pc would have a better processor and graphics, a greater amount of ram, a better cooling system and a better quality source. Xbox series x specs are almost equivalent to a ryzen 7 3700x desktop processor paired with radeon rx 6800 or nvidia rtx 3070. In short, matching the series x on price just isn�t possible.
