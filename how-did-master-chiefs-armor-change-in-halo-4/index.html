Halo 4 Forward Unto Dawn Master Chief Jefe maestro de From pinterest.com
How did master chief’s armor change halo 3 4? Showing him removing it in 4 was more for “thematic” reasons, showing his more vulnerable, “human” side in conjunction with the overall plot. Was there ever an explanation for how master chief�s armor changed so drastically from halo 3 to halo 4? We don�t see any other realistic opportunities after the ark battle where the chief takes off his armor.
