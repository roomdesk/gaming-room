Crysis Remastered CGMagazine From cgmagonline.com
North korean soldiers and mercenaries were the main enemies with a race of ancient aliens mixed in for good measure. Crysis 2 and 3 differ vastly from the franchise�s debut. The crysis franchise developed by a german team had the player don a “nanosuit” which enhanced physical abilities and allowed for cloaking options to add some interesting gameplay elements.
