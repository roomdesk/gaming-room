Is There a PS5 Slim? Push Square From pushsquare.com
While i think there will be an upgraded ps5 in the future i dont think a “slim” version is the one we will see, for one simple reason, heat. As to the person that pointed out ps5 struggling to run some games at 4k60 now? I think they would need to go to 5nm. If the ps5 is looking like it�s going to be prohibitively expensive, sony could opt to offer two consoles:

<p>Ps5 and series x are not underpowered to any degree, and there won�t be a clear milestone like 4k for refresh consoles to hang their hat on. Even then, due to the cooling requirements, i expect there will never be a slim model.

<p>The ps6, though still several years away, will hopefully let you more easily expand the internal storage, be slimmer than the ps5, have no disc drive, and (if we�re allowed to dream) include enhancements like a wireless charging pad and modular upgrade. There are tons of games that can still be played on the ps4 pro.

<p>Slim consoles, consoles with more storage etc. I�m skeptical about how slim either the series x or ps5 is going to get, given the heat generated and the size of the cooling/fans/heat sinks, etc. (of course, the longer someone has to wait to get a ps5, there is the chance they buy a competitor�s console instead.) ps5 backwards compatibility to ps4 games was a great decision (and long overdue!).

<p>The ps4 slim came out three years after the standard ps4 console hit the market, so we won’t expect a ps5 slim to hit stores until at around 2023.

While i think there will be an upgraded ps5 in the future i dont think a “slim” version is the one we will see, for one simple reason, heat.

<p>That second 2023 was supposed to be 2024 😅. No one had any clue how big the ps5 was going to be until people started scaling it off the drive. I think they would need to go to 5nm. Is There Going To Be A Ps5 Slim ITSTAKESTWO.</p>

<p>Even then, due to the cooling requirements, i expect there will never be a slim model. As others have said, i think it�s much safer to bet on a ps5 slim model. The lack of production of ps5�s and the fact that they are so hard to find also has me considering saving up and just building a gaming pc. We Don�t Know if PS5 Will Be Our Last Console, Admits.</p>

<p>And it could deliver considerably more power. If you do end up getting a ps5, you can still play ps4 games until more ps5 games are released (i think forspoken looks promising). I think they would need to go to 5nm. Everything We Know So Far About the PS5.</p>

<p>Even then, due to the cooling requirements, i expect there will never be a slim model. While i think there will be an upgraded ps5 in the future i dont think a “slim” version is the one we will see, for one simple reason, heat. (of course, the longer someone has to wait to get a ps5, there is the chance they buy a competitor�s console instead.) ps5 backwards compatibility to ps4 games was a great decision (and long overdue!).

<p>Although there hasn�t been any news released, and likely won�t be for some time, we�re guessing a new version of the gaming console will come around 2027, likely in november ahead of the holiday season. That’s just speculation on our part though. Historically, sony tends to release a slim version of its consoles three years after launch. Is There Going To Be A Black Version Of Ps5 GELOMAI.</p>

<p>The ps4 slim came out three years after the standard ps4 console hit the market, so we won’t expect a ps5 slim to hit stores until at around 2023. There needn’t be any doubts that sony will release a ps5 slim in the coming years. Lavanny (topic creator) 1 year ago #8. Ps5 Pro Slim Playstasion 5 Device Release Free.</p>

Robert43s 1 year ago #7. I�m hoping there is a slim model that is just more normal, i don�t need my console to stand out this much.
