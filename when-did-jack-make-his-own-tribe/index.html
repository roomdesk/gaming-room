After ralph mocks jack’s hunters as “boys armed with sticks,” jack erupts into an angry diatribe and rails against ralph and his poor leadership skills. The excitement the boys felt when jack suggests killing a littlun in chapter 7 comes to grotesque fruition in chapter 8, during the vicious and bloody hunt following jack’s rise to power and formation of his new tribe. Jack leads a hunting party, and they kill a sow. Jack begins acting ever more like a cruel dictator to his own tribe members, having one of the boys tied up and beaten for angering him.
