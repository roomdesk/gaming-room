Best of all, every multiplayer thing in halo 5 takes advantage of microsoft’s azure dedicated servers in the best of ways. I spent less time matchmaking in halo 5 than in gears 5 and modern warfare.

Matchmaking is a multiplayer system that provides players the ability to enter into a game with less effort.
