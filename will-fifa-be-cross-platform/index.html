FIFA 21 EA says no to crossplatform, crossgeneration From youtube.com
This company really is a joke. The game can only be played on a single platform, which means that players who want to play with their friends will have to purchase the same console in order for them to be able to enjoy the game together. Console users can only play against people on their console model while pc users are limited to pc multiplayer only. Ea does not seem to be fans of cross platform play and they haven’t changed their stance for this year’s soccer title.
