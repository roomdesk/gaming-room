<p>I mean some of us canï¿½t afford a pc but they got a ps$ or they got it as a gift, for example.

While some games support keyboard and mouse directly, like neverwinter, smite and tera, apex legends is not one of them. Each game developer has to add kb/m into their games and it is up to them.</p>
