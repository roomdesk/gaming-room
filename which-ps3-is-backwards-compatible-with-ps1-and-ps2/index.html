Sony PlayStation 3 Fat 80GB Backwards Compatible CECHE01 From ebay.com
If its the 80gb version with only 2 usb ports then it only supports ps1 games backwards compatibility. Both the ps2 and ps3 are capable of running ps1 games, but other than that gamers have not been able to play ps2 or ps3 games on the most recent playstation console. As far as i�m concerned, the slim ps3 does not have any backwards compatibility. Which would be a huge shame given how transformative backwards compatibility would be for ps1 games.
