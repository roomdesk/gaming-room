From venturebeat.com
Windows is quite slow as compared to linux which is a big advantage. I have seen videos of people going into game files and changing quailty settings to even lower than low settings for other games and i want to know is there anything like that for halo infinite. Will i be able to run this game? U can play anything other than halo 2 anniversary, h2 anniversary is intensive, but ur hardware can run it in low presets, because it works in mine.
