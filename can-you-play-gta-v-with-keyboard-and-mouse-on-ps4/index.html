Byba Fortnite Gaming Mouse And Keyboard From marshmelowbyba.blogspot.com
Full controller support means will work without a mouse and keyboard, from installation to play. Does anyone play on ps4 using a keyboard &amp; mouse? Its the 60fps and keyboard and mouse for me. In gta iv you could move a joystick and you would be on controller, then move mouse and you were on keyboard and mouse, that was partial controller support, gta v has full controller support.
