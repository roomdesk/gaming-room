Jan. 21st… The Halo around the moon… Beautiful From pinterest.com
A lunar halo (also known as a 22 degree halo) is a hazy ring that occurs at a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the moon. And it’s not so much spooky foretelling, but rather pretty mundane science. Halos are represented throughout history as signifying a person, an event, an experience as being holy or exuding a divine majesty. If you see a halo around the moon on a clear night, it could be an indication that bad weather is moving in.
