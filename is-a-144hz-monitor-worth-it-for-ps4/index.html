<p>It replaced a philips elph monitor and my scores in games went up a good bit, timing critical games became more enjoyable, losing in games felt more fair like it was my fault rather than having a few frames too late display. If you like more games other than fifa, it�s not worth it. If your computer can handle 240hz monitors, it is 100% worth the upgrade since it is the most popular commercially available, high refresh rate in monitors today. It also has outstanding low input lag for a responsive gaming experience.</p>

<p>But, if you�re like me and you enjoyed every upgrade from 60 hz monitors to your current 144hz monitor, the natural progression is you�d upgrade to a 240 hz monitor. Full hd (1920 x 1080) has been the industry standard for gaming displays for a while now. This doesn’t mean the monitor will stop working if you use a 60hz only console, it’ll just lower itself to 60hz for that console, if you were. 27&quot; ASUS ROG XG27VQ 144hz 4ms LED Curved Monitor RGB at.</p>

<p>I reviewed, tested and played with the benq mobiuz ex2510 24.5 inch monitor, as well as going over whether a 144hz monitor is worth it for fortnite. Frankly we just don’t know how many games will support 120fps, i mean demon souls and avengers both have dedicated fps modes that lock them to 60fps instead of having all the effects. 1080p displays should also be pretty easy to power with even a budget gpu.

<p>Maybe this will change later on in the generation, but then i�d imagine by then 1440p/144 monitors will also be cheaper, so no reason to change now. A 144hz monitor can refresh the animation on the screen 144 times a second. You could, theoretically, grab a 1440p monitor with a refresh rates of 60 hz and a response time of 5 milliseconds and be able to game on it, but despite the higher image quality it still won’t perform as well as a 1080 pixel monitor with 144 hz refresh rates and a 1 millisecond response time for the same price.

<p>If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. In other words, when you use a 144hz monitor for ps4, the monitor’s refresh will remain at 60hz until you connect a device that requires a higher refresh rate.
