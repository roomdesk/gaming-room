Crysis Remastered On Nintendo Switch Looks REALLY GOOD From youtube.com
The quick answer is that they did a stellar job porting the game to switch in spite of the system�s limitations, and it�s as good a way to play the game as any, especially if you want it portable. After the crysis 2 &amp; 3 remastered patches for nintendo switch, we�ve released another patch, this time for crysis remastered. Most surprisingly, the addition of svogi (sparse voxel octree global illumination) is a major improvement in lighting quality. All 3 games have been updated to look and run amazingly well and playing in handheld mode will genuinely blow you away.
