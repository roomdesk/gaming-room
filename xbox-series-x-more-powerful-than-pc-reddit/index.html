XBOX 2 IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE PS5… YouTube From youtube.com
If anything, my xbox pc is more akin to the xbox one x of yore when it comes to noise levels, if not slightly louder. Microsoft’s new tower of power is significantly more powerful than the one x and does eclipse the older xbox console in practically every other department, too. Consoles aren�t going to be as powerful as pc�s because of hardware and cooling limitations. This is another downside of opting to build your own pc as opposed to simply going down the console route, but in terms of power, it definitely puts in a pretty good performance.
