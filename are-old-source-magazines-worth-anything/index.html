The answer is yes, the magazine is highly collectable as stated earlier. The price of an old school projector will depend on the age, model, and condition of the projector. The very early copies, those from around 1955, are now worth around $100 each, up to a few hundred for the first 10 or so editions. The value of old magazines is that you can get more knowledge,or you can learn histories,what happened in the past.magazines also gives you knowledge from time to time.
