How to a Halo pro gamer From redbull.com
The top 3 activities you can grind are griffball, firefight, and invasion from arcade firefight you get about 11k xp total (if you are on the top scoring) from heroic firefight you get about 12k xp total (if you are on the top scoring) minimum from each activity by performance (if you are on the top scoring) is 8k xp. This would be the challenge i recommend to save for last as its really not worth all the effort. That cap is much, much easier to hit in certain game modes. You can think of season points in halo reach as one of the currencies in the game.
