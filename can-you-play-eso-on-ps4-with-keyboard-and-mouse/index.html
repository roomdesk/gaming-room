Byba Can You Play Fortnite With Mouse And Keyboard On Ps4 From marshmelowbyba.blogspot.com
We used a group of dualsense, keyboard and mouse as an example, but you can use xbox controller on ps4, or literally any gamepad that rewasd supports! If you get a keyboard that has usb ports in it (so, effectively contains a usb hub) then you will be able to plug your mouse and a usb headset into it, or a usb to 3.5mm adapter that you can plug a 3.5mm headset into. If you want to play ps4 games with a keyboard and mouse there aren’t many options, unless you opt for the hori tactical assault commander pro, or an adapter. There’s some that argue a controller is more of an advantage too because of the native aim assist that it has.
