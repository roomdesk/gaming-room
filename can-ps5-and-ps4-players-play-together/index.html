2 Player Ps5 Games On Same Console My Game Collections From danielmeccapoesia.blogspot.com
But as a pc player i really do want to play both on my living room tv as well on the desk in our computer room and the ps5 sadly only has one hdmi out for some reason, so the plan was to use a ps4 pro in the living room. Why ps4 players and ps5 players cannot play gta online together. If one person is on the ps5 version and the other two are on the ps4 version the ps5 player will not be able to play online with those who are on the ps4 version of the game. There is no crossplay between the ps5 version and the ps4 version of fifa 22.
