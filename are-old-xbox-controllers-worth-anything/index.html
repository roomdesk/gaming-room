Official Microsoft Xbox One S 3.5mm Wireless Controller From ebay.co.uk
Battlefront 2 is a hard game to find for a reasonable price so. I imagine one could easily cave in a guy�s skull with an xbox, but only if they could lift it first. However, systems can range in price from $20 to $115 depending on the condition the console is in. Original xbox consoles sell for $51 on average, based on recently sold ebay listings.
