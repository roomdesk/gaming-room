GTA Gaming Archive From gtagaming.com
Specially if you are sticking to online as the worst bits happen in the story mode (the whole torture &amp; snipe mission could have been left out of the game). Also the level and intensity of the violence in the game at such a young age could damage them especially since it is quite realistic. Is gta v ok for 10 year olds? If my kid was 16 years old and acted like a 5 year old he is sure as hell not playing gta.
