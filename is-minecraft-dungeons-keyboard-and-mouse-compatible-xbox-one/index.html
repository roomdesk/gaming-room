Xbox One &#34;Official&#34; KEYBOARD and MOUSE RIP Controllers From opcoesbinariasestrategias.com
Last night i purchase minecraft dungeons on my surface go via the xbox app assuming i�d be able to use the keyboard / mouse pad of the surface go, but the game controller seems to come up as the only control / accessibility option.

Might be able to because you can on regular minecraft not sure though because i don’t have minecraft dungeons. How to customize your character in minecraft dungeons.
