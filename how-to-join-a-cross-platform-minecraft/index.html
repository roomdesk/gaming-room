Here�s why Sony rejected Microsoft�s request for cross From neowin.net

No matter what platform you�re playing on, this fix requires that you be inside of minecraft. However, the workaround that has proven useful for me is for the host to invite you to the world they have open from their pause screen and for you to accept the invite from the main minecraft menu with play/settings/store. Also from my understanding the only things that will transfer are realms.
