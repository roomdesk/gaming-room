A hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting of hydrogen and carbon found in crude oil, natural gas, and coal. And yet hydrocarbons can be very small or very large, can include straight chains of carbons or elaborate branching, and can have. A “benzene ring,” named after the simple aromatic chemical benzene, or a phenyl group when part of a larger structure, is the configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds.

<p>Halogenated hydrocarbons, also known as halocarbons, are hydrocarbon compounds in which at least one hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen (group vii a of the periodic table) atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine. Halogenated hydrocarbons are chemical compounds containing carbon and hydrogen atoms and one or more halogens (bromine, chlorine, fluorine, iodine) in their chemical structure to form organobromine, organochlorine, organofluorine, and organoiodine compounds. Aromatic hydrocarbons, often known as arenes, are aromatic organic molecules made up entirely of carbon and hydrogen. Halogen Easy Science Easy science, Periodic table, Halogen.</p>
