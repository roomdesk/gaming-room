<p>You might wanna look up outward. If you press options (don�t know what the equivalent botton is on xbox) you can find a tutorial that teaches you about different kind of quests and when you can co op and when you can�t. But yes, it�s an awful, unintuitive system that no modern day game should have. Monster Hunter World Open Beta coop gameplay pt11 Epic.</p>

<h3 id="while-it039s-great-to-be-exploring-the-world-of-monster-hunter-stories-2">While It�s Great To Be Exploring The World Of Monster Hunter Stories 2:</h3><p>World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at yo. This means that players no longer have to progress through checkpoints in their hunts and complete cutscenes before others can join them. It�s hella tedious and arbitrary but it�s functional and eventually when you�re out of those main missions you don�t have to do it anymore. At that point you can all abandon and then go to the quest board/desk and jump into the last person to finish the cutscenes game.</p>
<h3 id="you-both-have-to-enter-the-quest-solo-and-play-until-you-watch-the-cutscene-then-you039ll-seeyou-can-now-fire-an-sos-once-you-see-this-one-of-you-leaves-and-the-other-fires-the-sos-so-the-one-that-left-can-join">You Both Have To Enter The Quest Solo And Play Until You Watch The Cutscene Then You�ll Seeyou Can Now Fire An Sos, Once You See This One Of You Leaves And The Other Fires The Sos So The One That Left Can Join.</h3><p>So basically any story mission just requires a quick wait, and any optional, events or investigations you do can be done as full co op. If i remember correctly you can�t co op on expedition quests and some missions require you to be a certain hunter rank. Have everyone in your group start the same story quest solo, get to the point where everyone has seen the cutscene, then have all but one of you leave their quests and join the one who didn�t leave theirs. It�s just as bad and unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="players-will-need-to-watch-the-cut-scenes-before-being-able-to-sos-out">Players Will Need To Watch The Cut Scenes Before Being Able To Sos Out.</h3><p>But other times i feel like this can drag down the story. The solution for playing expeditions with friends in monster hunter world isn’t immediately apparent, though. Yeah, both of them need to enter the quest and reach the sos flare point. World on the playstation 4, a gamefaqs message board topic titled you seriously can�t coop story missions?.</p>
<h3 id="you-do-only-have-to-play">You Do Only Have To Play.</h3><p>In monster hunter world, playing with other people will make hunting for dangerous beasts more manageable. It can be done, it�s just often pretty difficult to manage, and sometimes leads to weird design compromises if it�s not done right. During pvp, you and your opponent. Ago you can do (almost) all story quests together, you just all have to get in the mission, trigger the cutscene, bail out and then someone can host the mission and the others can join.</p>
