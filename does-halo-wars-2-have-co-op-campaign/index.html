Halo Wars 2 Coop Campaign Let�s Play Mission 6 From youtube.com
Chris and seth start the campaign sequel to one of the only rts games they�ve played together, halo wars 2 for the xbox one. I�m not sure i�ll even buy it if it doesn�t have coop campaign. Unfortunately, at this point in time halo wars 2 does not contain a split screen option. This means around may 2022, but no official date has been confirmed and 343 industries did not.
