Halo Infinite Cortana Message From Cortana Found In Halo From hussaincoates71.blogspot.com
While many of its contemporaries focus solely on the shooting and war elements, halo stands out for its vast world building. In the infinite series, there is hardly any physical appearance of spartan locke. Before you get your hopes up, it�s worth knowing that the arbiter doesn�t feature in the halo infinite story campaign. The remnants of the unsc forces on zeta halo are scattered and in disarray, having effectively lost a lengthy conflict with the banished.
