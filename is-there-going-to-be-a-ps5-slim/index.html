<p>Last month there were murmurings of sony planning a ps5 slim with a refreshed 5nm processor. Ps5 slim, will there be a ps5 slim, will sony release a ps5 slim, playstation 5 slim, ps5 slim release. There are some renders going around on twitter of what a ps5 pro might look like, alongside a ps5 slim. Then there’s the ps4 professional, able to 4k gaming over the principle console’s 1080p.</p>

<p>Earlier this year a patent surfaced from sony that suggested the company is working on ai technology equivalent to dlss. If that is anything to go by, we can see the same happening for the ps5 in 2023 or 2024. While it made sense for the ps4 pro to be released (in order to capitalize on the growing popularity of 4k tvs), a ps5 pro may also need to have some kind of notable selling point for it to be appealing to consumers, and with no new tv technology on the horizon, it�s hard to say what that would be.
