<p>If anything, compared to previous installments, i really think exodus is more forgiving regarding your moral choices. Depending on what players do throughout the game, they will either see the bad ending or the good ending, with the latter likely being the canonical ending, if past games in the series are anything to go by. To get the good ending, you have to keep two out of three of your traveling companions with your group and keep them alive throughout the entire plot, which is easier said than done if you don�t know how to go about it. Primarily because there’s not much indication of what to do to fulfil it.</p>
