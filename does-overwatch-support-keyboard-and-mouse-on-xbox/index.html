Best keyboard and mouse for Xbox One Dot Esports From agency.dyndns.ws
There’s at least one mouse and keyboard user every other game on ps4. This means that your system should recognize your peripherals as soon as you plug them into your console. If you wish this title to support the mouse and keyboard feature on xbox one, you should reach out to the developers as they will ultimately decide if they are going to support the feature or not. I�d love to try a controller/mouse hybrid type setup on the console.
