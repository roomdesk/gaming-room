Lunar Halo Moonbows Ring Around the Moon From thoughtco.com
Weather folklore says a ring around the sun or moon means it will rain soon. The rainbow or halo around the moon appears due to the ice and dust particles from the atmosphere. Many of these appear near the sun or moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. Also, notice that the sky surrounding the halo is darker than the rest of the sky.
