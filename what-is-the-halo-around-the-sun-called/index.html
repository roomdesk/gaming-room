Halo around sun seen by many Tuesday afternoon From kxan.com
It was like a ring around the sun. These halos are always a perfect circle, but you may not always see the full circle if clouds are in the way. Rings around the moon are called lunar halos or moon halos. Scientifically, halos are called 22 degree halos because the two refractions bend the light by 22 degrees from its original direction.
