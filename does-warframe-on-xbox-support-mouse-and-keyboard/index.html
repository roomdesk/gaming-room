The game is currently in open beta on pc, playstation 4 &amp; 5, xbox one &amp; series x/s, and nintendo switch.
XIM3 Mouse and Keyboard on Xbox 360 MW2 Demo 2 YouTube From youtube.com
The xbox interface itself frustratingly doesn�t support mouse and keyboards either, so to navigate, sign in, and so on, you�ll still need to have your controller present and handy. I had a spare junk mouse(acer something) that works fine, but the right mouse button is broken and it doesn�t have extra buttons so it�s not the best experience. Microsoft is finally adding the official feature of mouse and keyboard to the xbox one, but we will have to wait because not all the games will support that feature, it will depend on game developers who want to integrate that feature into their games. Warframe mouse and keyboard fully supported, except for first screen when starting the game.
