<p>Rubber stick extenders won�t dramatically make it easier to aim like a mouse and keyboard. For example, an xbox one polls at 125hz (8ms) and a ps4 polls at 250hz (4ms).so in the case of using mouse &amp; keyboard on a console, you must set the polling rate of the mouse to 250hz.if you only have a 500hz option, that should work fine. The popularity of that console means that, if a workaround for keyboard and mouse exists and can be used on the platform, you can be sure it’ll be found and exploited. You can play with mouse and keyboard in AC Valhalla, Cold.</p>
