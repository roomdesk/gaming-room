<p>The biggest difference between the two is that unlike spartan iis, spartan iiis were trained for better combat effectiveness in teamwork and tactical skills. Noble 6 was rated to be just as lethal as chief, adding him would guarantee noble team takes this. Master chief (as of halo 1): Noble Six SPARTANB312 by RenikoSeika on DeviantArt.</p>

<p>Noble six vs master chief. Noble 6 in my opinion is more accurate with a gun and maybe more skilled in h2h as he shows before his (spoiler!!!) death. Chief could win in scenarios where he had a unique advantage (ambush, sniper, something like that). Noble Six Render [SPARTANlll Commando] halo.</p>

<p>He has torn his achilles’ tendon wile running to 100 km/h durability: Fell onto a planet from orbit in halo 4, without a scratch. Now, finally adding arbiter back into the equation, all three of these deadly soldiers known together, biggest matchup that could not lose any battle when all together. Pin on Halo.</p>

<p>Hmmm.good matchup well let�s analyse:chief is 41 years old and is a spartan 11.he is typically armed with a m90 cqc shotgun,a m6d magnum,a br225 battle rifle and two fragmentation grenades.he is 7,2 in armor and still a whopping 6,10 out of armor,he is quick witted, an amazing tactician and a born leader.six is the opposite he has a lone wolf personality often taking jobs. Why is doomguy so angry? The master chief would win. Hyperlethal Play Arts Kai Halo 4 Master Chief and Noble.</p>
<h3 id="with-cortana-jacked-into-his-head-john-would-easilly-overpower-six-due-to-enhanced-capabilities">With Cortana Jacked Into His Head, John Would Easilly Overpower Six Due To Enhanced Capabilities.</h3><p>Now, finally adding arbiter back into the equation, all three of these deadly soldiers known together, biggest matchup that could not lose any battle when all together. I�m going with the dark horse and saying that the odsts will win. Chief could win in scenarios where he had a unique advantage (ambush, sniper, something like that). Who would win master chief vs noble six.</p>
<h3 id="in-character-but-have-direct-orders-from-unsc-to-kill">In Character, But Have Direct Orders From Unsc To Kill.</h3><p>They�d probably end up killing each other honestly. So much so that noble 6 does not even come close. The reality simply is that master chief has been able to serve decades and engage in a countless number of operations against threats to humanity, becoming one of the unsc�s most decorated and well known heroes.

<h3 id="the-master-chief-would-win">The Master Chief Would Win.</h3><p>The only one who could be a bit of a probem for mc is noble 6. Since the master chief and noble 6 are both classified as hyper lethal, who would win? Master chief doesn�t need medpacks, and noble six does. Mc is a spartan ii so he has better genes making him taller/faster/stronger/etc.</p>
<h3 id="chief-and-noble-6-easily-if-they-were-teamed-up">Chief And Noble 6 Easily If They Were Teamed Up.</h3><p>But if cortana was out of his jack, six and the master chief would have a hard time fighting and defeating one another. Master chief can assassinate by punching, and noble six needs to do all this complex karate bs. Noble 6 was rated to be just as lethal as chief, adding him would guarantee noble team takes this. So chief does succeed, he gets cortana to the pillar of autumn, but where do they go from there?</p>
