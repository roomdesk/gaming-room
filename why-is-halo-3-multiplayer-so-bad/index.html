<p>It never caught on much but it plays really well, limited sandbox is probably the biggest downside. In short, the higher the fov, the faster the game looks/feels. I loved playing zombies and just f***ing around on halo 2 back in the day, but hated the matchmaking, hated it in 2004 and i hate it now, ugh. Online will be using a game from 2007 as its base.</p>

<p>What you�re missing is that in 2001, the open outdoor spaces w/ vehicles felt extremely fresh, the regenerating shield mechanic + choose two main guns mechanic were new, and the addition of dual stick controls + lan play revolutionized console multiplayer fps. It�s worse in duos if you start bad in duos then there is a 95% that your teammates leave. Not the gameplay, but rather the players and matchmaking.

<p>Due to this, you see a lot less on the screen, and it feels as though you’re looking through a tunnel. Imo it was the limited maps and being attached to everything mcc went through, good or bad.
