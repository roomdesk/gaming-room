<p>Halo infinite was the most exciting game on my list for this year, and in the span of 30 or so hours, i finished what is arguably the worst. If it would have been released on xbox series x, the result would have been different. Halo infinite stuttering and lag issue is a common problem in xbox as well.

<p>I am playing on a i5 6600k (oc to 4.3 ghz) and a r9 3080x (wich is technically too bad for the game) and 8gb or ram so i know that i cant expect miracles in performance.
