Halo Infinite Multiplayer FanArt Red Team halo From reddit.com
Many free games focus way too much on monetization, and i’m worried this will be one of them. It�s bad because the menus are kind of all over the place. The open world is mediocre, the story is mediocre, the characters suck. Monetization and progression could be better, but i�m sure you guys will fix them.
