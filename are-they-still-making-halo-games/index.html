<meta name="description" content="48 Review Are They Still Making Halo Games References, Halo is a military science fiction media franchise created by bungie. I think it was still bungie, thought that was a bug in their game and they wanted to get rid of it and we asked them �please.
Halo Infinite�s Sandbox Content Is 90 Complete, Reveals From purexbox.com
And yes, because i�m that nerd who read the fall of reach, seeing og spartan iis kelly, linda, and fred show up in a game did make me briefly happy. The franchise is currently managed and developed by 343 industries, and owned and published by xbox game studios. Imo they are good at making games, but i think only bungie could make that true halo feel and sadly, i’m almost certain that era is forever in the past. For this game to basically provide nothing new to the genre, and basically rehashed abilities from other game doesn�t make it feel like a halo game.
