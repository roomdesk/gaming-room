3player split screen HALO 4 gameplay YouTube From youtube.com
Yep, it�s just two player splitscreen and the top view on three player splitscreen that gets pillarboxed to 864 pixels of width. With my testing this only seems to work in halo 3. The bottom two players on three player splitscreen along with four player splitscreen both make use of the full width of the screen. Does halo 3 4 have split screen?
