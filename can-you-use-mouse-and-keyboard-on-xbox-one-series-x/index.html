How to use a Keyboard and Mouse on PS4 &amp; Xbox One From youtube.com

You can plug the mouse or keyboard into the usb ports on the front or back of the console. I decided to go xbox this gen because the gpu’s that are comparable or better than a series x are too hard to find. Notably, wireless mice and keyboards can also connect to the xbox one if the game is compatible.
