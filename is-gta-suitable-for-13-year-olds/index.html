Replacement of tram.dff in GTA San Andreas (33 file) From libertycity.net
The game gives the player to become the ceo of a company and deal with the stock market so it is a good teaching opportunity. Is gta 5 ok for a 11 year old? A 13 year old can definitely play the game without any problems as i did years ago when the game first came out. It would all depend on the soundness of her arguments, her demonstration of maturity in situations prior to the presentation, and her willingness to talk to me about what she experiences while playing.

<p>This game is fine for any mature 13 year old and up. A 14+ year old yes but with some restrictions.

<p>Overall its a pretty good game for mature people, considering gta shows that it�s based in a huge city and small towns around it, but if i can give some advice for parents who wants to buy this game for their nephew, niece or children, maybe you should reconsider that, there are plenty of other good games for children the age of 7 to 16, just not gta, because. Also the level and intensity of the violence in the game at such a young age could damage them especially since it is quite realistic. A 13 year old can definitely play the game without any problems as i did years ago when the game first came out. yolagraydesigns What�s The Difference Between Gta 5 And.</p>
