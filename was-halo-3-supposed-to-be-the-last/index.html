Odst was to convey to whoever played it that halo was not all spartans turning the tide of the war (they did that too) but that millions upon millions of other humans (billions over the course of the entire war), be it shipboard personnel, marines, odst, were all fighting to keep their race from being exterminated and destroyed in 2552 as the covenant. Reach is just the last halo developed by bungie. Finish the fight, marketing is such a beautiful thing that people won�t even know you�re just making up words.
