Master Chief Soon in Quake Champions halo From reddit.com
Master chief has spent the majority of his life as part of a team, 6 is a lone wolf who spent his entire time before the events of reach operating on his own. Master chief wins in the best fight known to man. I think this is one of the closest fights you could possibly have but i think noble 6 would take it 51/100. Mc is a spartan ii so he has better genes making him taller/faster/stronger/etc.
