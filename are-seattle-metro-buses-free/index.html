<p>Metro is operating about 99% of its scheduled service with some canceled trips due to workforce shortages. Metro is improving weekday service while some minor service reductions continue. While the city doesn’t run the buses or light rail trains, we do run the streetcar system, and we work closely with other agencies to buy bus service, improve reliability, and make sure people can get where they need to go. If you switch to another system of transportation, then you’ll need to pay a new fare as metro fares are only good on metro buses (for instance, if you switch to a sound transit bus, your transfer will not work).</p>
