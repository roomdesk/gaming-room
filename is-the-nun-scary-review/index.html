[Review] �The Nun� is a Calmly, Consistently Creepy Slice From bloody-disgusting.com
Playing heavily on japanese horror influences such as the ring, the movie tries to be slow and psychological. The groundwork was there for this to be a very creepy movie. It’s a horror film and at places it attempts to be like one! You question yourself whether you are actually seeing what you think you are.

<p>Yes, the movie does take advantage of all of the opportunities for jumpscares and yes there is a lack of patrick wilson and vera farmiga but this movie is damn scary the first time you watch it and for that i appreciate it. As it stands, the nun may not be reason enough to believe in a higher power. The vatican sends a priest and a young nun to investigate a disturbing death.

<p>“the nun” couldn’t scare a church mouse. The thing i like in the nun is the dark environment, the graveyards, the church, and the surrounding that brought you back to the year 1933, i guess. A movie with grand ideas, but unfortunately the execution falls flat. YouTube removes trailer for �The Nun� because it�s �too scary�.</p>

<p>The vatican sends a priest and a young nun to investigate a disturbing death. I think the story of a secluded abbey in the romanian forest is the perfect setting for a good old fashioned demon scare. Early images of dimly lit rooms in the vatican and the first glimpses of the haunted abbey bring to mind atmospheric chillers like the exorcist or the orphanage. ‘The Nun’ Review The Least Scary (And Grossest.</p>

<p>Coming out of the gate as the proclaimed scariest film of 2018, “ the nun ” is indeed a frightful experience.
