Valve adds PS5 DualSense controller support to Steam API From whobserver.com
Considering the game is out on next gen consoles i would assume anything preventing that would be on the steam side tho. Hence, it’s difficult to transfer games between the two platforms. I know steam has really solid ps4 controller support but i haven’t checked if they have it for ps5 yet. I�m trying to play with a ps5 controller.
