<p>Imo, i think puff paint adds a nice dimension and feel to the suit, especially if you are doing a tasm1 suit. They didn’t even need to include the teasers to get everyone hyped for the sequel, so when i saw this trailer in the sony presentation, i was stoked. And 4 upcoming dlcs it feel like a rip off, compared to a game like witcher 3 this game shouldnt cost so much. It�s my reddit &quot;cake day&quot; so being that I�m a Marvel.</p>
