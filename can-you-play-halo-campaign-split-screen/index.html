Halo 5 Guardians Get Game Reviews and Previews for Play From dlh.net
You can play almost every part of halo: My only suggestion, you can refund and keep on eye on the game, see if it gets added in later, or just play the game as it is now and hope they add it in later. Can you play split screen halo on pc? I cant verify if you can use a guest (assuming you can) i was sharing a box with someone, using two separate accounts, and a third friend over live.
