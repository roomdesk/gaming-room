What happened to the Brutes AFTER Halo 3? YouTube From youtube.com
In halo 2 we see delta halo and high charity completely infested with flood. During the negotiations, covenant mercenaries led by shipmaster �gajat attacked the delegates. It�s either still there, or it got destroyed when installation 08 blew up. However, they both show that they have a newfound respect for each other in the 2 weeks between halo 2 and 3.

<p>Hey guys, welcome back to the second video of the weekend! But after halo nightfall we see that there are definitely parts of the original ring that could still support life and support the flood. Although, some sanghelli didn�t believe in the arbiters statement that the forerunner artifacts shouldn�t be touched. If you want to find out more about what happens in the halo universe then leave a comment below and i’ll post more on sundays.</p>

<p>It�s either still there, or it got destroyed when installation 08 blew up. So, this is what happened to noble 3 after the fall of reach.
