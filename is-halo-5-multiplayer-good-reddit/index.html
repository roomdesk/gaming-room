<p>After playing like 5 games in a row and seeing zero progression in the battlepass and level was disheartening. Most of the classic halo game types are under ranked games: The forge and custom games, in my opinion, have never been better. The map is a remake of haven from halo 4.</p>

<p>After some reads and my previous shooter games (cod, overwatch, destiny, battlefront) i think halo 5 is the better choice ? Every weapon has a perfect niche, the shooting is very clean and satisfying. But with this stronger focus on multiplayer, aka the real way most live games actually make money, the game�s campaign suffers. All Halo 5 Guardians maps free, Xbox Live Gold not needed.</p>

<p>Halo 5 had a good balance for the hardcore being developed in hand with pro�s but was awful at appealing to casuals with its garbage attempt at massive multiplayer matches aka warzone leaving whats its really memorably for 8v8 to. As of now you need to find 15 friends to play in a 16 person death match but it is still fun and makes for a good time. In no way am i saying that halo 5 is a better game than the rest.
