FIFA 21 trailer and everything we know about the next From trabilo.com
Virtually everyone plays with a controller (mouse and keyboard seems like a disadvantage anyway) so i can�t see why cross platform is such an issue. In simple words, playing against different platforms is not possible with the fifa 22 game. Press j to jump to the feed. It also means that xbox one players will not be able to create an account on pc or playstation 4, and vice versa.
