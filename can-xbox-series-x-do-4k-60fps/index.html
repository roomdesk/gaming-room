<p>Using a full hd tv, with a refresh rate of 60hz, you can play monster hunter world at just about 60fps on xbox series x through the console�s backwards compatibility. However, while the ps5 is capable of reaching 60fps with either option, the xbox series x can manage 120fps with the favor framerate option. However, we’d be extremely impressed if the game managed to maintain this at all times. The game may (or may not) require an optimization patch for the xbox series s or the xbox series x, but it really shouldn�t have any trouble hitting 60 fps, if not 120 fps, on those consoles, but that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>That includes confirming that the xbox series x will fully support streaming at up to 4k at up to 60fps. Fortnite is only 1080p/60fps on series s.

<p>Yes (on series x) no. No, but mostly because this isn�t really a question we can answer. But when you add in higher polygon counts, ray tracing, and more advanced ai and physics suddenly a lot of that extra power is used up and they now (may) need to make other sacrifices (resolution and/or fps) to the game.

<p>It can technically pull off 4k/60, but that will only be in lightweight indie games that aren�t graphically demanding (that same game runs 4k/120 on the series x, or actually renders at 6k at 60fps). Then path of exile is also coming to xbox one x at 4k/60fps. The xbox series x is a huge technical jump from its older sibling the xbox one. Xbox Series X Revelado jogo a rodar em 4K e incríveis.</p>

<p>I�m having a issue where the xbox series x is stating that your tv setup supports up to native 1080p at 120 fps within the general 4k tv details setting. The bloom effect is a bit bizarre sometimes but otherwise gta4 is a new beast on series x. If you take a one game and run it on series x there�s zero doubt it could run at 4k60 without an issue.

<p>Like it�s almost abstract art on the xsx. For example, when favoring quality, the standard playstation 4 and xbox one can run up to 30fps at 1080p, whereas the ps5 and xbox series x can reach upwards of 60fps at 4k uhd.
