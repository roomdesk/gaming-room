<p>Following the departure of bungie in 2007, microsoft created 343 industries which would act as an internal division to halo. Even though they now own the original creator of the halo series, sony. Don’t get me wrong, i loved the halo series. FileHalo4DidactArmorCutscene.jpg Halopedia, the Halo.</p>

<p>Assumimg bungie made a sequel to halo 3 rather than halo reach, i imagine a few things may stay the same. All the stats and content will be permanently lost to the ether. Bungie developers wanted to create a game they could consistently update, and they wanted to be able to respond to players’ desires in real time.

<p>That success requires us to give credit where it�s due. In 2007 bungie became independent again (the details of why are not public so all we can do is guess) but was still under contract to develop two more halo games under the microsoft banner as part of the deal.

<p>Microsoft continued with the development of the halo franchise by releasing halo 4, halo 5, and halo infinite also known as reclaimer saga under 343 industries. He did say in halo 4�s defense that he liked the character development other than lasky and del rio though. When the current owners of bungie took over the firm they did not get halo back.

<p>Why did halo 4 fail? But even though bungie did a great job, there are still a lot of things that they got wrong from halo 1 all the way up through halo reach. For example, the story is still more character focused like halo 4 was around chief and cortana and cortana is still suffering from rampancy.

<p>Almost nine years ago, stats and files from our previous franchise, halo, stopped getting updated on.
