A sundog is a concentrated patch of sunlight occasionally seen about 22° to the left or right of the sun. As with sundogs, hexagonal ice crystals suspended in cirrostratus clouds refract sunlight to create the halo, sometimes also called an icebow, nimbus, or gloriole. Sundogs often appear as colored areas of light to the left or right of the sun, 22 degrees distant and at the same distance above the horizon as the sun. Because it occurs due to internal reflection in ice crystals, it is produced only by clouds cold enough to consist entirely of ice particles rather than liquid water droplets.

<p>Sundogs are more scientifically known as an optical phenomenon called a parhelion, which means “with the sun.”. Technically known as parhelia (singular parhelion) they are often white but sometimes quite colorful, looking like detached pieces of rainbow, with red on the inside, toward the sun, and blue on the outside. As with sundogs, hexagonal ice crystals suspended in cirrostratus clouds refract sunlight to create the halo, sometimes also called an icebow, nimbus, or gloriole. There are some differences, however.</p>

Sundogs often form in pairs on either side of our daytime star when sunlight refracts through icy clouds containing hexagonal platecrystals aligned with their large, flat faces parallel to the ground.

<p>In medieval times, the three bright lights were sometimes interpreted as the sign of the trinity, a sign of great fortune. Since the clouds that cause them (cirrus and cirrostratus) can signify an approaching weather system, sundogs themselves often indicate that rain will fall within the next 24 hours.

<p>Sun dogs are “splotches” of light on one or both sides of the sun, sometimes with the colors of the rainbow. Sundogs are colored spots of light that develop due to the refraction of light through ice crystals. Why is a sundog called a sundog?

<p>Sundogs and rainbows have lots of elements which we need to interact with to see them and maybe it’s a natural jump to associate them with hope because all these facets have to coincide for us to see the colour. Sundogs often form in pairs on either side of our daytime star when sunlight refracts through icy clouds containing hexagonal platecrystals aligned with their large, flat faces parallel to the ground.

<p>Because it occurs due to internal reflection in ice crystals, it is produced only by clouds cold enough to consist entirely of ice particles rather than liquid water droplets.
