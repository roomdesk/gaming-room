Black Templar Space Marine Vs. Master Chief &amp; Noble Team From comicvine.gamespot.com
If i remember correctly from the books (it�s been awhile so correct me if i am wrong), they trained 150 spartans and were given their callsigns during training (because even the people who died or were disabled during augmentation had call signs).

Geoff and kerry show you a very short, but unmistakable shot of master chief at the end of halo reach.
