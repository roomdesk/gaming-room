<p>Halo 3 in my opinion. Mine is that halo 4�s campaign is not only better than 5, but it�s actually one of the best in the whole franchise (better than reach, 3, odst, slightly behind ce but nowhere near 2). Halo 3 vs halo 1 (internet speed reduction) the speed range for your line is 80/60mb and you are nowhere near that. Yes, the skill ceiling was incredibly high, but other than a few annoying map exploits, if you died in halo 3, it was because you were outplayed.</p>

<p>But i�ll admit the levels weren�t as designed as well as halo 3�s.

Mine is that halo 4�s campaign is not only better than 5, but it�s actually one of the best in the whole franchise (better than reach, 3, odst, slightly behind ce but nowhere near 2).

<p>Halo 3 vs halo 1 (internet speed reduction) the speed range for your line is 80/60mb and you are nowhere near that. I agree, i really like infinite, but i cant stop thinking about how slow it is, i feel that instead of going forward in terms of overall gameplay, we went backwards, halo infinite is a rare combination of halo 3, reach and part of 5, halo 5 felt fluid, fast, it felt like i was playing as a real spartan whereas in infinite im back to doing normal stuff Halo 3’s fileshare was also better because you could view it in matchmaking and the pregame lobby.

<p>I think its a much better balanced game and a much better experience online with forge, custom games, photos, saved films ect. Yes, the skill ceiling was incredibly high, but other than a few annoying map exploits, if you died in halo 3, it was because you were outplayed. Reach�s multiplayer is better than halo 3�s.

<p>Halo 3 had one of the weakest campaigns in the series, good multiplayer though, and the community was better back then as well. Its when the game really expanded. I�m not saying halo 2 sucks, but how can you say it�s better than 3. My attempt at replacing the Halo 4 cover art with Halo 3�s.</p>

<p>I think that is why i have more fond memories of 3. Halo 3 has better maps, better default settings, better matchmaking settings, and better ranks and exp.

<p>Yes, the skill ceiling was incredibly high, but other than a few annoying map exploits, if you died in halo 3, it was because you were outplayed. Default halo 4 is better than default halo: A battle rifle or pistol from halo 3 has no educational value. Am I the Only one Who Thinks Halo 3 looks better than MGS4.</p>

<p>Halo�s the type of game where you don�t need 30 vs 30 to make it fun, in fact it�s best played with 4 vs 4 for a lot of tense moments. If corrosion is due to homeowner problems then you may be charge for engineer visit but if external then should be free. Halo 3 had a few issues like the melee system and the non hitscan br, but it wasn�t as bad as halo 2 at the start. Video / Trailer Halo 4 ‘Covenant Weaponry’ Trailer.</p>

<p>Halo 2 is basically, find the rocket launcher and sniper rifle. I think both are over rated. Halo 3 is infinitely better because the game was competitive with or without a br start, and on halo infinite the sandbox is only balanced by having either one or the other.

<p>I was not a big fan of the gameplay that halo reach encouraged. Also halo 3+ and halo 3 with complete wifi are being offered at like 3+ for £5 extra a month and 3 with complete wifi at £3.00 extra a month are any of those twos a better upgrade from fibre halo 2 or is it just eh?

<p>I�m not saying halo 2 sucks, but how can you say it�s better than 3. 1) everything seems a little rushed story wise, just thrown at you, there�s not really a discovery and then a shocking revelation aspect to any of it.

I hated armour lock and sprint, although the new weapons were fun to use. I�m not saying halo 2 sucks, but how can you say it�s better than 3. You obivously didn�t play it all or for very long.</p>

<li>everything seems a little rushed story wise, just thrown at you, there�s not really a discovery and then a shocking revelation aspect to any of it. I preferred odst, because it gave me all the halo 3 maps, firefight, and a harder and, in my opinion, better campaign. I think its a much better balanced game and a much better experience online with forge, custom games, photos, saved films ect. I was not a big fan of the gameplay that halo reach encouraged.</li>
