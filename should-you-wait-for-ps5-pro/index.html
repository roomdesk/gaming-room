Should I get a ps4 pro or wait for ps5? YouTube From youtube.com
Buy neither of them and wait for a ps5. Moreover, it is only few months away so the wait would not be long. You could buy a 2nd hand ps4, but dont buy a new one or a pro, better to wait for the ps5 that will be compatible with ps4 games. The only reason we got pro models last gen was because the ps4 and xbox one launched with outdated tech and 4k became more mainstream in the middle of the gen.
