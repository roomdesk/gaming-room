You have to start eu4 from the library within the steam client and select nakama crossplatform multiplayer in the popup which you get in that case. Epic games store would allow you to link to facebook and steam at this time so if you have lots of gaming friends from these two platforms, you can easily add them once you connect your epic games. Then, in the epic games account, click add friend. steam should appear as an option. Not the one from steam or epic games.
