How Much Fps Is The Ps5 Going To Have On Fortnite From itstakestwo.blogspot.com
I’ve tried searching around, but the only specs i seem to find on the fps of the ps5 is that it’ll do 4k at 60fps (on some titles). Does this mean that most games will actually support 120 fps? As mentioned, however, the ps5�s increased power could, in theory. Generally wanting 120 frames per second means you�re actively wanting a reduced input latency environment.
