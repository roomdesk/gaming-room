Maybe because, when its actually designed properly, keyboard &amp; mouse is way better? Today i came back to ds3 and keyboard and mouse seemed unplayable so i just played it with controller. Played with just mouse clicking you.</p>
<h3 id="then-i-tried-keyboardmouse-and-it-was-night-and-day">Then I Tried Keyboard/Mouse And It Was Night And Day.</h3><p>You want contorl of direction more than anything else, and that is what controllers are good at. Some of these icons may not match to the actual buttons, but this is. That is not dark souls. I know the ps4 itself is compatible with keyboard/mouse, but i can�t find anywhere if dark souls 3 and bloodborne are.</p>

Dark souls 3 can be played on a gamepad or using a keyboard and mouse. This is not a shooter or rts, believe it or not, but there are games that are played better with a controller like dmc, dark souls, binding of isaac, etc.</p>
