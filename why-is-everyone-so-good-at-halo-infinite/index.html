We�re actually at a point in halo infinite where the pro players (theoretically the best players) are beginning to complain about the skill ceilings because of how much assist there is. 9ne reason i play big team battle is because less sweats but even then.at least you can fuck around doing silly shit in vehicles in btb. Yeah you got it right there.</p>
