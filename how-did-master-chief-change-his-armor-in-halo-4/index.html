<p>This made the armor one of a kind to both chief and cortana, but something that i�m curious about is how far into cortana�s rampancy did. I suspect the lore did drive the design a little bit, with the idea that better shields (tell that to the jackals) and biofoam injectors to handle light wounds, meant that mobility was more important than armor, hence the thinner panels. The games don’t show it, but in the novels, chief takes off his armor pretty regularly. Halo 4 Master cheif armor concept Halo armor, Master.</p>
