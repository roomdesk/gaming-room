<p>Halo 5’s campaign was a bit less reliant on external media, really only needing it for the backstories of the different spartans in fireteam osiris and blue team. Its not as bad as everyone makes it out to be because all anyone ever does is criticize it from a story stand point and its always the same hand full of meaningless complaints. Personally i really like the heavier emphasis on the books, but they could definitely benefit by providing a short introduction to things for people that don’t want to read a dozen novels to understand the story of their new.

<p>Halo 1 doesn�t feel special anymore because every modern shooter copied something halo 1 did first. What’s your honest opinions about the game here is my thoughts why the game is so bad because it has a lack of content what do i mean about that is most of the things are in multiplayer instead of the campaign like all the weapons and abilities are not in the campaign if you think about it compare that to the previous halo games even worst about this game is it’s a pay to win Halo 5’s campaign was a bit less reliant on external media, really only needing it for the backstories of the different spartans in fireteam osiris and blue team.
