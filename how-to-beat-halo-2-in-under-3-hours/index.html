Yeah, i figured that, but some of the ♥♥♥♥ has to be done perfectly (like getting the falcon/getting out of the map on winter contingency or getting the banshee at the beginning of new alexandria), and failing those over and over again would probably just end up tanking my time more than just going through the level.</p>
