PS4 is running another cool giveaway to gift one of their From pinterest.com
I recently got a ps4 slim, and while i was doing my research about the right display for it, in multiple threads here on reddit and elsewhere, i�ve read. 1080 p is better than 4k for the ps4, but consider getting a 4k 120 hertz monitor if you are planning on buying the ps5. Compared to the original ps4/slim, it’s significantly more powerful. The ps4 pro is different than the standard ps4 because you can play 4k games on it instead of 1080p.

<p>You also can�t get the advantage of 144hz because most games only run at 60 fps max. Any 1440p at 60hz monitor with a lower refresh rate, adaptive sync (gsync, freesync) are useless, and the ps4 pro can�t display 4k imagery nor high fps counts.
