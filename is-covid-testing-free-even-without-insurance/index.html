PhilHealth to shoulder hospital expenses of COVID19 From nolisoli.ph
A new federal law makes novel coronavirus testing free for patients without insurance, but it does not cover treatment related to the virus. Free, universal coronavirus testing is critical to flattening the arc of infection. If you purchase a test outside of your preferred network, your insurance company can cap your reimbursement fee at $12—meaning that even if your covid test costs upwards of $30, you will still. A social security number and/or government id may be requested, but is not required.
