Rumors Suggest Halo Infinite Could Receive Battle Royale From ghostlikehouse.co.uk
Infinite, not its multiplayer (you can see my multiplayer review here) so any qualms i may have about the battle pass and store will not be here. Halo 2 however, was fantastic, especially the anniversary version of it. With mgsv and now halo 5, i am getting really annoyed at trailers and ads making the story out to be something its not. Ever since that angryjoe review (i think) some are starting to think halos campaign is actually 4 hours long.
