<p>But you guys are right, it was probably just camera prospective in the last mission. I�ve heard it�s before 3, yet, 3 is directly after 2. If you�re talking about why he seemed bigger in the end cutscene than the rest of the campaign, i think it�s because the last cutscene was cgi. Did 343 remember Spartans are tall yet? Halo 5.</p>

<p>With as much armor as master chief�s suit holds, he appears a few inches taller than he actually is. It�s clear from the opening cutscene in halo 4, as well as several others, that master chief is much taller than his fellow soldiers.

<p>I’ve looked at the cutscene and it doesn’t look like master chief is on a raised platform. As normal kids were starting puberty, spartans looked like they�re in their mid 20�s., so it�s reasonable to assume he ends up looking older. And actually, in the level infinity, the chief was in fact, only an inch or two taller than palmer. Halo 4 hidden Ending (Master Chief Removes Helmet) YouTube.</p>

It�s clear from the opening cutscene in halo 4, as well as several others, that master chief is much taller than his fellow soldiers. If you’re talking about why he seemed bigger in the end cutscene than the rest of the campaign, i think it’s because the last cutscene was cgi.
