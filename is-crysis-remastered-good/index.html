Crysis Remastered Çok Yakında, 2020 Crysis 2, Oyun, Alcatraz From pinterest.com
Crysis remastered reminds us of a time when aaa pc games weren’t hindered by console ports. Some people are upset that the remaster makes numerous design changes to be more like crysis 2, from removing quicksave to rebalancing all the guns, reducing recoil, and defaulting to a streamlined version of the nanosuit. Crysis is that special unique title that has endured and even has its fans asking for more. I�d normally leave conversations about value to you and your wallet, but crysis remastered is £28 via the epic games store, while the original game is £18 on steam or £15 from gog.
