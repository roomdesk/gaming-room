<p>Recommendations for metro exodus game settings? Mature sexual themes, intense violence, partial nudity, strong language, blood. Legion is whatever, there’s some fun to it but it feels undercooked.

<p>I looked forward a lot to this game, and i am enjoying it a lot. Unfortunately epic games got involved and bought out the exclusivity platforms rights to have metro exodus only sell on their, at the time, new epic games store, built to rival steam. I am going to play it for the first time and wanted to know is there any setting i should change, any specific setting that lowers frame rates?

<p>If you’re at all interested in the story, play them in order (2033 &gt; last light &gt; exodus). I�m disappointed and don�t feel like the developer cares about it�s game and fans.

<p>Its good games like metro exodus that can stand the test of time. No disrespect for whoever likes this game, but clearly you haven�t really played a good game to consider this one. Metro has always been a cult classic series, but the grander scale of the latest game takes into the territory of the fps genre’s most illustrious titles. Metro Exodus Review New Game Network.</p>

<p>I’d say play ori first. Yakuza:lad is a good game, but it’s slow as hell grindfest with sudden difficulty spikes, still, very refreshing jrpg. Metro exodus is fine, probably the biggest graphical showcase of the bunch, i wouldn’t call it must play tho. [Metro Exodus] [Screenshot] This games graphics are.</p>
