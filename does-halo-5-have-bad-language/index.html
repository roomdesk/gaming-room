<p>However, an unnamed 343 industries source speaking off the record to alanah dropped one more bit of information, namely that halo infinite was completely reworked and delayed because of the fan�s poor reception to the way the story was moving in halo 5: The change here is that regardless of which protagonist.

<p>However, it seems strategical as it reveals how the game would look like on the pc as it is going to be released on pc as well.

<p>I’ve known halo 5 servers to be terrible, and it’s not on my end. I don�t think evil is the right word.

The reason i am critical of cortana’s appearance in halo 5 is because i see it as 343 responding to the criticism they got of how she looked in halo 4. Theres no gore or swearing in game still, but the game has a microphone system where players can talk to one another via headsets. You may hear d<em>mn h</em>ll b<em>stard and a</em>s sex:</p>
