Can you use a keyboard and mouse?
Select Xbox Insiders can now try mouse and keyboard From onmsft.com
These accessories can only be used to browse the web and type messages to your friends. The only downside is that the menus are not optimised for a controller so i have to use the mouse for those, but the game itself plays great. Here, you can learn some keyboards and mice that can be used on xbox. I never played the pc version so idk if there are any differences but it works great.
