Noble 6 original by thethrash87 on DeviantArt From thethrash87.deviantart.com
~halo reach (female noble six) six saw the elite aiming his rifle at the slipspace drive on the pelican. Are you with the epsilon eridani fleet? noble 6 asked. Noble six watched kat typing on her devise. Let’s say noble 6 survives by making it aboard the pillar of autumn (because i think it makes for a way more interesting “what if” than if he just survives on reach in hiding) halo 1 would’ve played out relatively the same but with 6 just giving the chief a helping hand.
