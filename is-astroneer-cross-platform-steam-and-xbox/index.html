<p>I have a pc copy, my friend has consoles (ps4/x1), and is waiting on an answer to buy it. Nope, it will never work pc to pc with the dif versions but servers are coming soon and we should all be able to play together on there. U can make ur own server but thats only between steam players, renting a server will cost u between 10 and 6,66 euros, depending if u choose for 30 day or 365 days.

<p>It will eventually be possible via dedicated servers (and because of console security concerns you will need an official one from nitrado), but it sounds like that feature is getting delayed until ps4 can also get it, and i haven�t seen an updated eta. If your version is the windows store version and <em>not</em> the steam version you can both play together if he gets the xbox1 version. This applies to both platforms.
