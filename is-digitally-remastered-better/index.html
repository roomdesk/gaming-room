When they take on a project to digitally rework a classic recording, they treat it like a surgeon operating on someone’s child. Remaster refers to changing the quality of the sound or of the image, or both, of previously created recordings, either audiophonic, cinematic, or videographic. In reality, it often means they destroyed or greatly reduced the original dynamics and subsequent musicality.</p>
