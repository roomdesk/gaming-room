<p>Absolutely no near apocalyptic scenarios, or galactic conquest and genocide to speak of. Outside of lore it�s because people whined about cortana�s sexy appearance in the previous halo games, not understanding that the reason why cortana appears like that is to make humans more comfortable around her.

The studio, which took control of the halo franchise from bungie when destiny was on the horizon, has had a rough time continuing on the narrative of master chief. If the game�s legendary campaign is completed, another halo ring is also seen as cortana hums a cheerful tune. Guardians delayed the release of halo infinite considerably.</p>
