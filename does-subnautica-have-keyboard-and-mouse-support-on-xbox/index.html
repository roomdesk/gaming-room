Keyboard Gaming And Mouse Gamingreview From keyboard.gamingreview.biz
Does anyone know if this game supports usb controllers or is it strictly mouse and keyboard. You may have to wait a few seconds while the ps5 detects your new peripherals. (though i�d rather not spend the $40 on a steam controller) I know i�m late but unfortunately no there is not.
