Can you use a keyboard and mouse to play Apex Legends on From quora.com
In terms of input lag and response time yes, but it won’t feel as good especially since most games on console were meant for controller. Having to touch the controller once every 15 minutes seems a silly way to play. When you use a keyboard and mouse, the game audio and party chat all still run through the (default or elite xbox) controller, which without any input shuts off after 15 minutes thus dropping all audio. Connect your keyboard and mouse via the usb ports on your ps5 console.
