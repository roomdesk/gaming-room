Crysis Remastered Trilogy Bundle Announced For Fall 2021 From segmentnext.com
Even though the game has only just been revealed via a leak (from official sources), plenty of you are wondering “will crysis remastered have multiplayer?” in this guide, we’ll let you know if there will be any kind of crysis remastered multiplayer mode or modes. Since crysis trilogy is coming out, we got confirmation that it won�t have multiplayer for any of the games included. Of course, the project have already been delayed which probably means we will see crysis 2 sometime in february 2021 while crysis 3 could arrive later in 2021 or even in early 2022. That becomes less of a problem as you get into the meat of crysis 2, but those first few hours are a bit of a slog.
