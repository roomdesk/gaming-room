Does Terraria Support Crossplatform Play? All You Need to From fox.net.in
The pc is on version 1.3.5 ps4 and xbox one just got updated to 1.3.5 (and still sadly still don�t have cross play compatibility with each other or pc) and the switch is currently way behind at version 1.3.0.7 or 1.3.1 (can�t remember which) Terraria is only cross platform on mobile, meaning you can only crossplay terraria between ios and android devices. It will be possible to play together with your friends on playstation 4, windows pc, linux, mac, ios, android, google stadia, playstation 3 and playstation vita. If you are a microsoft fan and purchased terraria on any of the most recent xbox consoles, you may play with your pals as long as they are also playing on an xbox.
