Noble 6 vs Master Chief (Mark V) (read the OP) Battles From comicvine.gamespot.com
Master chief wins in the best fight known to man. Its a shame 6 dies because i like him more than master chief, 6 doesnt have a very deep personality. As a lieutenant noble 6 outranks master chief, and could theoretically be placed as his commanding officer.being an officer provides noble 6 with more human resources at his fingertips and the ability to give direction and lead. Yoda lived to be about 900 years old and whilst darts vader was in his late 40s, he could diffuse the energy of a laser blaster bolt.
