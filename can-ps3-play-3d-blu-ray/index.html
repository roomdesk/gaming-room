<p>I�m using a benq mx711 dlp projector connnected by hdmi. Download the media player from playstation store, if you do not have one. Ps3 is fine, i used one for blu and 3d blu for a while before i got a dedicated unit, at the time i was using it the only thing that was a constriction is that when in 3d mode, you didnt get the hd audio codecs available, now i believe the firmware allows this too, so even better.
