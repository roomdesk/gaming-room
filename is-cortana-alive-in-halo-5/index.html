<p>Next, master chief gets an ‘upgrade’ or rather is evolved. Cortana�s survival is revealed in halo 5, when she calls master chief to the forerunner world genesis. Cortana explains she survived the destruction of the didact�s ship and her own rampancy by entering the domain, an ancient repository of knowledge. We weren’t privy to the conversation itself, but the librarian does tell us this later in the game.</p>

<p>Cortana is a major character in the halo series, initially appearing as the deuteragonist of the original trilogy and halo 4, she returns as the main antagonist of halo 5: For now, it seems cortana is still well and alive. My problem with this theory is that if cortana really was a puppet of guilty spark in halo 5, none of his actions were at all going to help get a human to retrieve the index he needs to light the halos.

<p>First, let’s remember that cortana ‘spoke’ with the librarian on requiem. I think it�s safe to say that many of 343�s writing decisions in halo 4 and 5 ranged from strange to laughable, and probably one of the worst offenders was cortana as a villain.
