From Tracie Ring Around The Sun From fromtracie.com
These halos are always a perfect circle, but you may not always see the full circle if clouds are in the way. Sundogs, also called “mock suns” or “parahelia” (greek for “beside the sun”), appear as one or two patches of light on either or both sides of the sun. Some say that this circle around the sun is a bad omen, but i would have to agree with the native americans: Its radius is roughly the length of an outstretched hand at arm�s length.

<p>Halo around the sun or moon, rain or snow soon. the halo around the sun or moon is a layer of cirrus clouds made of ice crystals. These moon dogs, like sun dogs, form to the left and right of the moon along or near the halo. If one looks through a telescope and observes it, there are no such rings like those found in other planets. A cloud called cirrostratus is made up of ice crystals.</p>

<p>A sun halo, a circle of light that creates a circle 22° wide around the sun, is a related phenomenon. Scientifically, halos are called 22 degree halos because the two refractions bend the light by 22 degrees from its original direction. In the scientific community, it is known as a 22 degree halo but is also known as a halo, moon halo, moon ring, or winter halo. Mexico Halo sun from optical phenomenon triggers.</p>
