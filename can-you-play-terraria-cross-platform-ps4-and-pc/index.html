However, it is currently not supporting so that you may join the same game on different platforms. So, yes crossplay is supported between these two device types. Every player will need to be on the same type of device in order to play together.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-is-your-canvas-and-the-ground-itself-is-your-paint">The World Is Your Canvas And The Ground Itself Is Your Paint.</h3><p>Currently its android with iphone, playstation with xbox and pc with pc.

Is terraria crossplay between xbox one, xbox series x|s, ps4, ps5 and nintendo switch consoles? Thanks to this, you can now play terraria online on the big screen using xbox, playstation series, pc, mobile, nintendo switch, and so on. The main reason for this is the promotion of console gaming by terraria.</p>
<h3 id="yes-terraria-is-indeed-cross-platform-compatible-between-the-ps4-and-the-ps5">Yes, Terraria Is Indeed Cross Platform Compatible Between The Ps4 And The Ps5.</h3><p>Well the answer is yes terraria can be cross play between ps4. Can you play terraria cross platform on ps5? This disables the players using pc and ps4 from player terraria with each other.
