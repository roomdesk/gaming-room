<p>I know a lot of headlights come with some type of uv protection embedded or layered on the lens, which polishing could damage/remove. Whilst yellow light improves visibility in wet or foggy conditions, it can also be harder to see with yellow lights in clear conditions. The polycarbonate lens’s exposure to air and the effect of uv rays contribute to the discoloration. As a result, many vehicles today use yellow lights only as fog lights.</p>

It not only helps the fans/crews tell them apart, it also helps the drivers recognize which cars are behind them (so they know to defend their position from someone in their class, but to allow the upper classes by). Good lighting on vehicles and slower speeds, especially at night and in inclement weather, are the best routes to take for safety and not this path to every car having brighter headlights.

<p>In endurance racing there are typically several classes racing at the same time (as there isn�t time for individual races).

This was back in the day of glass headlights, now we�ve got tempered glass so if it does actually shatter, it breaks off into dull pieces, regardless of any tape.
